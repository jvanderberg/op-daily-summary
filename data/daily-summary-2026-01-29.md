## Village of Oak Park

Oak Park celebrated its top property improvements at the 2025 Cavalcade of Pride Awards, recognizing six residential properties and several commercial properties for exceptional upgrades that enhance the village's architectural character. The awards highlight residents' ongoing investment in maintaining Oak Park's distinctive neighborhoods.

The Village is taking action on several fronts to keep residents safe and informed. Free flu and COVID-19 combination tests are available at Village Hall during business hours as flu cases spike nationwide to their highest levels in over two decades. With dangerous cold weather hitting the area, the Public Library branches are serving as warming centers, and officials urge residents to check on neighbors while following safety guidelines like layering clothing and protecting pipes from freezing.

Oak Park achieved significant recognition by earning an 'A' score from CDP, making it the only Illinois municipality on the organization's 2025 environmental leadership list. The Village also approved its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest increases in utility rates - refuse collection will rise to about $31 monthly for 96-gallon carts, while water and sewer rates increase slightly. Residents need to register for the new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme, as the Village has switched to a new Everbridge platform that allows customized notification preferences.



## OPRF High School District 200

Oak Park's high school is making notable progress on multiple fronts this winter. The district's new Project 2 pool is set to open this fall, featuring a 25-yard by 40-yard swimming facility that will primarily serve students but may offer expanded community access through Sunday hours, evening sessions, and periodic open swims. Officials are working out the details for public use while maintaining existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park.

The OPRF Jazz Ensemble has earned statewide recognition with an invitation to perform at the prestigious Illinois Music Education Conference in Peoria on January 29, 2026 - an honor given to only a select few ensembles across the state. Local residents can catch the acclaimed 22-member group at two upcoming performances: February 3 at the high school and February 18 at Chicago's Jazz Showcase, where they'll open for jazz artist Bob Lark.

Meanwhile, school will proceed as scheduled on Monday, January 26, despite dangerous wind chills between -15 and -20 degrees forecast through noon. The district is encouraging families to dress warmly and limit outdoor exposure while maintaining normal operations.
