## Summary

I notice this document appears to be internal board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97 rather than a traditional news article about a recent announcement or event. These are governance guidelines that were established on July 27, 2021, outlining how board members should conduct themselves in various situations.

The protocols cover key areas including board member expectations for professional conduct, procedures for handling community concerns, guidelines for media communication, and rules about electronic communication and social media use. The document emphasizes that board members should "speak with one voice," with only the board president authorized to speak on behalf of the board to media, and includes specific procedures for school visits and public comment periods during meetings.

Rather than announcing a new policy or event, this appears to be an existing governance document that establishes operational standards for how Oak Park ESD 97 board members should interact with each other, district staff, and the community. The protocols aim to ensure professional conduct and clear communication channels while maintaining appropriate boundaries between board governance and day-to-day district operations.
