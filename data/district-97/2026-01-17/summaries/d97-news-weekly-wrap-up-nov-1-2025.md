## Summary

This presentation provides guidance on how to navigate and understand Illinois school report cards for the 2023-2024 school year. The material explains how parents and community members can access their school's report card through the Illinois Report Card website (www.illinoisreportcard.com) and understand the snapshot view that displays basic school information, indicators, and district statements.

The presentation details how schools receive summative designations based on accountability indicators, with different weightings for elementary/middle schools (50% for student growth on Illinois Assessment of Readiness) versus high schools (50% for graduation rates). Schools are ranked and categorized into five designations: the bottom 5% receive "Comprehensive," the top 10% earn "Exemplary," and the remaining 85% are labeled "Commendable" or "Targeted" if they have low-performing student groups.

For Oak Park residents, this information helps them understand how to evaluate their local schools' performance by accessing detailed data that can be disaggregated by grade level or demographic groups, compare results with district and state averages, and review school climate data from the 5Essentials Survey. The report cards provide transparency in educational outcomes and help families make informed decisions about their children's education.
