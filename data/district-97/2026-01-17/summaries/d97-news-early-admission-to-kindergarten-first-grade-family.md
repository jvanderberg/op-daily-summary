## Summary

This document outlines the Oak Park Elementary School District 97's Board Protocols, which were established on July 27, 2021. These protocols serve as a comprehensive set of guidelines governing how board members should conduct themselves and interact with each other, the superintendent, staff, and the community.

The protocols cover key areas including board member expectations (treating each other with respect and assuming positive intent), handling community concerns through proper chains of command, maintaining unified communication through designated spokespersons, and respecting confidentiality during closed sessions. Important guidelines address electronic communication and social media use, emphasizing that board members should be judicious with district-related posts and avoid "reply all" emails to comply with Open Meetings Act requirements.

These protocols impact Oak Park residents by establishing clear procedures for public engagement, including structured public comment periods during board meetings with 3-minute time limits and designated procedures. The guidelines also outline how board members should conduct school visits, ensuring they act as observers rather than evaluators, and maintain a "no surprises" policy to ensure transparent communication between board members and the superintendent. These protocols aim to ensure professional, transparent, and effective governance of the school district while providing appropriate channels for community input.
