## Summary

This document is not a news article but rather a set of internal governance protocols for the Oak Park Elementary School District 97 Board of Education that were established on July 27, 2021. The protocols outline professional standards and procedures for board members to follow in their official capacity.

The protocols cover comprehensive guidelines for board member conduct, including expectations for respectful communication, proper channels for handling community concerns, unified public messaging, confidential information handling, and electronic communication restrictions. Key areas addressed include social media usage restrictions for board members, procedures for school visits, public comment protocols during board meetings, and information sharing requirements where all board members receive the same data when one member makes a request.

These protocols appear designed to ensure professional governance, maintain public trust, comply with legal requirements like the Open Meetings Act and Freedom of Information Act, and establish clear boundaries for board member interactions with staff, students, and the community. The document emphasizes the importance of board unity, appropriate communication channels, and maintaining the distinction between individual board member roles and collective board authority.
