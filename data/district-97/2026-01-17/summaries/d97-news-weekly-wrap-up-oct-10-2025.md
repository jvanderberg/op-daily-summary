## Summary

The Oak Park community is offering Early Childhood (EC) Screening services for children ages 3 to 5, providing comprehensive developmental assessments in multiple key areas. The screening evaluates children's hearing, vision, coordination, speech, cognitive development, and social-emotional skills to create a developmental snapshot and identify any children who may need additional support before starting school.

Parents can schedule appointments by calling 708.524.3134. The screening program serves as a valuable resource for families, offering parents the opportunity to consult with early childhood professionals about their child's development and receive important information about their child's growth. The service aims to identify any developmental factors that could potentially interfere with a child's learning and overall development, helping ensure children are ready for their educational journey.
