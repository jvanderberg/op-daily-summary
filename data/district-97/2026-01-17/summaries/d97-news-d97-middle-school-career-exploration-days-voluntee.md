## Summary

This document outlines the board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, which were established on July 27, 2021. The protocols serve as guidelines for how school board members should conduct themselves in various situations, including board meetings, community interactions, media communications, and school visits.

The protocols cover key areas such as treating each other with respect, maintaining confidentiality during closed sessions, and speaking with "one voice" as a board - with only the board president authorized to speak on behalf of the board to media. Board members are expected to direct community concerns through proper channels and avoid using electronic communications or social media to discuss district business among themselves. The document also establishes procedures for public comment during board meetings, limiting individual speakers to 3 minutes during designated times.

These protocols impact Oak Park residents by establishing clear boundaries for how board members will interact with the community and handle concerns. Residents can expect consistent communication procedures, with the board president serving as the primary spokesperson, and they have designated opportunities to address the board during public comment periods at meetings. The protocols aim to ensure professional conduct and unified decision-making from the school board while maintaining transparency in district operations.
