## Summary

District 97 has released its 2025-26 Identity & Heritage Calendar, which recognizes various heritage months and cultural observances throughout the school year. The calendar was developed collaboratively with community input as part of the district's commitment to inclusion and awareness, aimed at honoring all student groups in Oak Park schools.

The calendar highlights major heritage months including Black History Month (February), Hispanic/LatinX Heritage Month (September-October), Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month (May), and Native American Heritage Month (November), among others. It also includes important observances such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth, Indigenous Peoples' Day, and International Women's Day. Additionally, the district acknowledges Disability Pride Month and includes recognition of LGBTQ+ Pride Month and History Month.

This initiative impacts Oak Park families by helping them understand when various cultural celebrations and observances occur throughout the school year. The district also provides guidance for religious observances, encouraging families to communicate with schools about student needs related to fasting, prayer, or absences during major holidays. District officials note that while the calendar may not be exhaustive, they welcome additions and review it annually to ensure continued representation of all community members.
