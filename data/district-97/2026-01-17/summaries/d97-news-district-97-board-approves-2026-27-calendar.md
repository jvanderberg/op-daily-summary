## Summary

This document outlines board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, establishing guidelines for board member conduct and operations established in July 2021.

The protocols cover key areas of board governance including member expectations (assuming positive intent, treating each other with respect), handling community concerns through proper chain of command, maintaining unified communication with the superintendent and media, and respecting confidentiality during closed sessions. The document also addresses electronic communication restrictions to comply with the Open Meetings Act and Freedom of Information Act, including prohibitions on "reply all" emails and opinion-sharing via text or email between board members.

Additional provisions cover social media use (limiting personal editorial when promoting district business), public comment procedures during board meetings (3-minute time limits, only board president responds), and guidelines for school visits by board members. The overall theme emphasizes unified decision-making, proper communication channels, and maintaining professional boundaries while serving the Oak Park community. The "no surprises" policy ensures transparent communication between the superintendent and board members at all times.
