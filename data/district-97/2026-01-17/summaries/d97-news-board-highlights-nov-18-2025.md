## Summary

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 has released its 2026-27 academic calendar, outlining key dates for the upcoming school year. The school year will begin on July 26, 2026, with the first day of student attendance, and conclude on June 9, 2027, with the last day of student attendance and distribution of third trimester report cards. The calendar includes 176 total student attendance days divided into three trimesters of 58, 58, and 60 days respectively.

The calendar features several scheduled breaks throughout the year, including Labor Day (September 7), Thanksgiving Break (November 25-27), Winter Break (December 21-31 and January 1), Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 18), Presidents' Day (February 15), Spring Break (March 29-April 2), and Memorial Day (May 31). Family-teacher conferences are scheduled for October 22-23 and February 11-12, with evening sessions available for working families. The district has also built in five emergency days (June 10-16) to account for potential weather-related closures.

This calendar structure provides Oak Park families with advance notice to plan around school breaks and important academic milestones. The trimester system allows for regular assessment periods, with report card distributions scheduled at the end of each trimester. Parents should note that no planned absences should be scheduled until after the last emergency day, as the official school year doesn't end until those days are completed if needed.
