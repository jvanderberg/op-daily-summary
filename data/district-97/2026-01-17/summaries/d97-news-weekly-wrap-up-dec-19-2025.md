## Summary

This document presents feedback from a comprehensive superintendent search process conducted by the Illinois Association of School Boards for Oak Park schools. Dr. Carmen I. Ayala, an IASB consultant, led nine focus groups with 100 total participants, including students, parents, teachers, staff, administrators, community members, and board members, gathering input on what qualities Oak Park wants in its next superintendent.

The feedback revealed consistent themes across all stakeholder groups, emphasizing the need for strong instructional leadership, transparent communication, and genuine commitment to equity and the community's values. Participants want a visible, approachable leader who builds trust, supports educators while maintaining high expectations, and demonstrates stability with long-term commitment to the district. Students prioritized safety and having their voices heard, while parents emphasized academic excellence and consistency across schools.

The search process is moving forward with a clear timeline: the posting closes January 7, 2026, followed by candidate presentation to the board on January 13th, first-round interviews on January 26th and 28th, a community town hall on January 29th, and second-round interviews on February 2nd. This structured approach ensures that Oak Park residents will have multiple opportunities to participate in selecting a superintendent who aligns with their community's shared values and educational priorities.
