## Summary

This document is not a news article but rather a formal policy document that outlines the official Board Protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, which were established on July 27, 2021.

The document establishes comprehensive guidelines for how board members should conduct themselves in various situations, including interactions with the community, media communications, and school visits. Key provisions include requirements for board members to treat each other with respect, direct community concerns through proper channels, maintain confidentiality of closed session discussions, and follow specific protocols for electronic communications and social media use. The guidelines also specify that only the board president can speak on behalf of the board to media, and establish clear procedures for public comment during board meetings with a 3-minute time limit per speaker.

These protocols appear designed to ensure professional conduct, transparency, and effective governance for Oak Park residents. The guidelines emphasize unity among board members while protecting confidential information and ensuring proper communication channels between the school district administration, board members, and the community.
