## Summary

District 97 has announced its emergency closing procedures and e-learning protocols for the upcoming winter weather season. The district prioritizes student and staff safety, and the superintendent makes closing decisions based on weather forecasts, building conditions, transportation availability, and street conditions, typically in consultation with neighboring districts and village officials. The district aims to communicate closure decisions by 8 p.m. the night before or no later than 5:30 a.m. through multiple channels including email, robocalls, social media, and their website.

The district operates under two closure scenarios: E-Learning Days when there's sufficient advance notice, and Emergency Days for sudden weather developments. E-Learning Days allow for continuity of education with approximately five hours of learning through both live and self-paced instruction, with no impact on the school calendar. Elementary students begin with 8 a.m. attendance via Zoom, while middle school students start at 9 a.m., using various learning management systems like Seesaw, Google Classroom, and Canvas.

For Oak Park residents, this means families should review the e-learning plan, follow the district's social media accounts for updates, and sign up for text notifications. All students have been issued devices, and the district has implemented the "Internet for All" program to support at-home learning. The comprehensive plan was approved by the state and school board in 2021, ensuring the district is well-prepared to maintain educational continuity during winter weather emergencies.
