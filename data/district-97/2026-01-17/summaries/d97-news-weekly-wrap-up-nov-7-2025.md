**Oak Park School District 97 Announces Comprehensive Identity & Heritage Calendar for 2025-26**

Oak Park School District 97 has released its 2025-26 Identity & Heritage Calendar, designed to recognize and celebrate diverse cultural, ethnic, and identity groups throughout the academic year. The calendar was developed collaboratively with community input as part of the district's commitment to inclusion and awareness, honoring all student groups within the school community.

The year-long calendar highlights numerous heritage months and observances, including Hispanic/LatinX Heritage Month (September-October), Black History Month (February), Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month (May), and LGBTQ+ Pride Month (June), among others. It also marks important holidays such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Indigenous Peoples' Day, and Juneteenth as school closure days. Additionally, the district emphasizes the importance of religious observances and encourages families to coordinate with schools regarding student needs related to fasting, prayer, or religious absences.

This initiative reflects Oak Park District 97's ongoing effort to create an inclusive educational environment that represents and supports its diverse student population. The district notes that while the calendar may not be exhaustive, it welcomes additions and will review it annually to ensure continued representation of all community groups.
