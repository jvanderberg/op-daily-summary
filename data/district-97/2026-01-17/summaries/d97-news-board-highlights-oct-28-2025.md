## Summary

District 97 provided a comprehensive update on their ongoing middle school redesign initiative at the October 28, 2025 Board of Education meeting. The presentation, led by Assistant Superintendent Dr. Luis Fernando De Leon and the principals of Julian and Brooks Middle Schools, focused on four key priority areas: creating more structured lunch/social time, ensuring consistency between both middle schools, redefining the purpose of intervention programs, and improving transitions from 5th to 6th grade.

The district has implemented several significant changes for the 2025-26 school year, including replacing the SOAR program with a new "What I Need" (WIN) model that offers consistent course offerings across both middle schools. The WIN program includes targeted interventions in reading and math, executive functioning support, African American Studies, and access to Algebra. Additionally, the district has improved social time during lunch with better supervision, increased physical activities, and more structured expectations at both schools.

The Middle School Connection program for incoming 6th graders has shown strong success, with nearly 600 students participating across both schools and 97% reporting the program helped prepare them for middle school. Looking ahead, District 97 plans to continue evaluating and improving these initiatives, with upcoming presentations scheduled throughout the school year on various topics including student services, social-emotional learning, and curriculum updates. These changes represent a comprehensive effort to create more responsive, challenging, and equitable learning experiences for all Oak Park middle school students.
