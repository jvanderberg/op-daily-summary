## Summary

Oak Park Elementary District 97 has announced its updated academic acceleration policy in compliance with Illinois' Accelerated Placement Act. The district will offer both single subject acceleration (allowing students to advance to higher-level classes in specific subjects) and whole grade acceleration (advancing students to higher grade levels). Interim Superintendent Patrick Robinson and Director of Teaching and Learning Emilie Creehan presented the program details, emphasizing that acceleration services are available to ALL students, not just those previously identified as gifted and talented.

The acceleration process begins with family information sessions on February 18, with application windows opening March 2 and closing April 24. Students must undergo comprehensive evaluation including standardized test scores, teacher surveys, and end-of-year placement testing scheduled for April 11, 25, and May 9. To qualify, students must earn 80% of points on the district's evaluation rubric. The district has also clarified the distinction between state-mandated acceleration opportunities and their separate "Access to Algebra" program, which helps 5th-7th grade students get on track for Algebra by 8th grade through bridge courses or meeting specific test score criteria.

This policy expansion significantly impacts Oak Park residents by providing more equitable access to advanced academic opportunities for all students, regardless of previous gifted program identification. Families will receive final notification of acceleration decisions by June 2, giving them time to plan for the upcoming school year.
