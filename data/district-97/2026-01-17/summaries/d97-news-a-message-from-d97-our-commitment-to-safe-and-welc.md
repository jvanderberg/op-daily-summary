## Summary

This document does not appear to be a news article but rather an internal governance document outlining board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97. The document was established on July 27, 2021, and contains comprehensive guidelines for board member conduct and operations.

The protocols cover various aspects of board governance including member expectations (assuming positive intent, treating each other with respect), communication policies (board president as media spokesperson, restrictions on electronic communications), and procedures for community engagement (three-minute public comment periods, proper protocols for school visits). The document also addresses confidentiality requirements for closed sessions, social media usage guidelines, and information sharing protocols.

These protocols appear to be designed to ensure professional conduct, maintain transparency, and establish clear procedures for how Oak Park ESD 97 board members should interact with each other, district staff, and the community while fulfilling their governance responsibilities.
