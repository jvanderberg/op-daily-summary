**Oak Park School District Proposes Nashville Field Trip for Eighth Graders**

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 has announced plans for its eighth-grade class field trip to Nashville for March 14-16, 2026. The proposal, presented to the Board of Education on September 16, 2025, follows student voting where Nashville was selected by 73% of the eighth-grade class. The trip will include visits to Fisk University, Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, Music Row, and a planetarium, aligning with the district's Career Explorer educational goals.

**Financial Impact and Equity Considerations**

The district projects spending $63,540 to cover costs for students qualifying for free and reduced-price lunch, with 118 current eighth graders in this category. This represents a significant increase from the $31,254 spent on the previous year's St. Louis trip, though still below the $106,206 spent on Washington D.C. in 2024. Oak Park Township will continue providing $300 family stipends per student. The proposal emphasizes the district's commitment to racial and educational equity, ensuring all students can participate regardless of financial circumstances, with participation rates historically hovering around 50-55% of eligible students.
