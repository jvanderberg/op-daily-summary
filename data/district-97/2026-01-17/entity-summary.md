# School District 97 - 2026-01-17

School District 97 has announced major changes to its academic acceleration program, making advanced learning opportunities available to all students rather than just those previously identified as gifted. Starting with information sessions on February 18, families can apply for either single-subject acceleration (advancing to higher-level classes in specific subjects) or whole-grade acceleration from March 2-April 24. Students must score 80% on a comprehensive evaluation including standardized tests and teacher assessments, with final decisions coming by June 2.

The district has also released several upcoming events for families. Early childhood screening services are available for children ages 3-5 to assess developmental readiness before starting school - parents can schedule by calling 708.524.3134. For families with kindergarten-age children, an Early Entrance Family Information Session will be held January 28 at Julian Middle School to help parents understand early enrollment options.

Looking ahead to next school year, District 97 has approved the 2026-27 academic calendar, which will begin July 26 and end June 9, featuring 176 student days organized into three trimesters. The district continues its superintendent search process with community input sessions and expects to make final interviews in early February. Additionally, eighth-graders voted to travel to Nashville for their March 2026 field trip, with the district committed to covering costs for students receiving free or reduced lunch to ensure all can participate.

Oak Park Elementary District 97 has announced its updated academic acceleration policy in compliance with Illinois' Accelerated Placement Act. The district will offer both single subject acceleration (allowing students to advance to higher-level classes in specific subjects) and whole grade acceleration (advancing students to higher grade levels). Interim Superintendent Patrick Robinson and Director of Teaching and Learning Emilie Creehan presented the program details, emphasizing that acceleration services are available to ALL students, not just those previously identified as gifted and talented.

The acceleration process begins with family information sessions on February 18, with application windows opening March 2 and closing April 24. Students must undergo comprehensive evaluation including standardized test scores, teacher surveys, and end-of-year placement testing scheduled for April 11, 25, and May 9. To qualify, students must earn 80% of points on the district's evaluation rubric. The district has also clarified the distinction between state-mandated acceleration opportunities and their separate "Access to Algebra" program, which helps 5th-7th grade students get on track for Algebra by 8th grade through bridge courses or meeting specific test score criteria.

This policy expansion significantly impacts Oak Park residents by providing more equitable access to advanced academic opportunities for all students, regardless of previous gifted program identification. Families will receive final notification of acceleration decisions by June 2, giving them time to plan for the upcoming school year.

This document appears to be a community safety advisory rather than a traditional news article, but here's a summary of the key information:

**Main Announcement:** Oak Park's school districts and police department have issued comprehensive safety guidelines for youth who are independently traveling around town, whether walking to school, visiting local shopping areas, or going into the city on weekends.

**Key Safety Guidelines:** The advisory emphasizes several critical safety measures including always walking in groups when possible, staying on well-lit sidewalks rather than alleys, remaining alert without headphones or texting, and immediately reporting any safety concerns to parents, police, and schools. Students are specifically warned never to approach unknown vehicles, even if occupants know their names, and to yell loudly and run if they feel threatened. Additional precautions include waiting near school buildings when waiting for rides and varying daily routes when possible.

**Community Impact:** This bilingual safety guide (provided in both English and Spanish) represents a collaborative effort between Oak Park's educational and law enforcement officials to ensure student safety during independent activities. The comprehensive nature of these guidelines suggests they are responding to community safety concerns and aim to empower both parents and students with practical tools for staying safe while maintaining age-appropriate independence.

This document outlines the board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, which were established on July 27, 2021. The protocols serve as guidelines for how school board members should conduct themselves in various situations, including board meetings, community interactions, media communications, and school visits.

The protocols cover key areas such as treating each other with respect, maintaining confidentiality during closed sessions, and speaking with "one voice" as a board - with only the board president authorized to speak on behalf of the board to media. Board members are expected to direct community concerns through proper channels and avoid using electronic communications or social media to discuss district business among themselves. The document also establishes procedures for public comment during board meetings, limiting individual speakers to 3 minutes during designated times.

These protocols impact Oak Park residents by establishing clear boundaries for how board members will interact with the community and handle concerns. Residents can expect consistent communication procedures, with the board president serving as the primary spokesperson, and they have designated opportunities to address the board during public comment periods at meetings. The protocols aim to ensure professional conduct and unified decision-making from the school board while maintaining transparency in district operations.

This document presents feedback from a comprehensive superintendent search process conducted by the Illinois Association of School Boards for Oak Park schools. Dr. Carmen I. Ayala, an IASB consultant, led nine focus groups with 100 total participants, including students, parents, teachers, staff, administrators, community members, and board members, gathering input on what qualities Oak Park wants in its next superintendent.

The feedback revealed consistent themes across all stakeholder groups, emphasizing the need for strong instructional leadership, transparent communication, and genuine commitment to equity and the community's values. Participants want a visible, approachable leader who builds trust, supports educators while maintaining high expectations, and demonstrates stability with long-term commitment to the district. Students prioritized safety and having their voices heard, while parents emphasized academic excellence and consistency across schools.

The search process is moving forward with a clear timeline: the posting closes January 7, 2026, followed by candidate presentation to the board on January 13th, first-round interviews on January 26th and 28th, a community town hall on January 29th, and second-round interviews on February 2nd. This structured approach ensures that Oak Park residents will have multiple opportunities to participate in selecting a superintendent who aligns with their community's shared values and educational priorities.

District 97 has announced its emergency closing procedures and e-learning protocols for the upcoming winter weather season. The district prioritizes student and staff safety, and the superintendent makes closing decisions based on weather forecasts, building conditions, transportation availability, and street conditions, typically in consultation with neighboring districts and village officials. The district aims to communicate closure decisions by 8 p.m. the night before or no later than 5:30 a.m. through multiple channels including email, robocalls, social media, and their website.

The district operates under two closure scenarios: E-Learning Days when there's sufficient advance notice, and Emergency Days for sudden weather developments. E-Learning Days allow for continuity of education with approximately five hours of learning through both live and self-paced instruction, with no impact on the school calendar. Elementary students begin with 8 a.m. attendance via Zoom, while middle school students start at 9 a.m., using various learning management systems like Seesaw, Google Classroom, and Canvas.

For Oak Park residents, this means families should review the e-learning plan, follow the district's social media accounts for updates, and sign up for text notifications. All students have been issued devices, and the district has implemented the "Internet for All" program to support at-home learning. The comprehensive plan was approved by the state and school board in 2021, ensuring the district is well-prepared to maintain educational continuity during winter weather emergencies.

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 has released its 2026-27 academic calendar, outlining key dates for the upcoming school year. The school year will begin on July 26, 2026, with the first day of student attendance, and conclude on June 9, 2027, with the last day of student attendance and distribution of third trimester report cards. The calendar includes 176 total student attendance days divided into three trimesters of 58, 58, and 60 days respectively.

The calendar features several scheduled breaks throughout the year, including Labor Day (September 7), Thanksgiving Break (November 25-27), Winter Break (December 21-31 and January 1), Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 18), Presidents' Day (February 15), Spring Break (March 29-April 2), and Memorial Day (May 31).

This presentation provides guidance on how to navigate and understand Illinois school report cards for the 2023-2024 school year. The material explains how parents and community members can access their school's report card through the Illinois Report Card website (www.illinoisreportcard.com) and understand the snapshot view that displays basic school information, indicators, and district statements.

The presentation details how schools receive summative designations based on accountability indicators, with different weightings for elementary/middle schools (50% for student growth on Illinois Assessment of Readiness) versus high schools (50% for graduation rates). Schools are ranked and categorized into five designations: the bottom 5% receive "Comprehensive," the top 10% earn "Exemplary," and the remaining 85% are labeled "Commendable" or "Targeted" if they have low-performing student groups.

For Oak Park residents, this information helps them understand how to evaluate their local schools' performance by accessing detailed data that can be disaggregated by grade level or demographic groups, compare results with district and state averages, and review school climate data from the 5Essentials Survey. The report cards provide transparency in educational outcomes and help families make informed decisions about their children's education.

District 97 provided a comprehensive update on their ongoing middle school redesign initiative at the October 28, 2025 Board of Education meeting. The presentation, led by Assistant Superintendent Dr. Luis Fernando De Leon and the principals of Julian and Brooks Middle Schools, focused on four key priority areas: creating more structured lunch/social time, ensuring consistency between both middle schools, redefining the purpose of intervention programs, and improving transitions from 5th to 6th grade.

The district has implemented several significant changes for the 2025-26 school year, including replacing the SOAR program with a new "What I Need" (WIN) model that offers consistent course offerings across both middle schools. The WIN program includes targeted interventions in reading and math, executive functioning support, African American Studies, and access to Algebra. Additionally, the district has improved social time during lunch with better supervision, increased physical activities, and more structured expectations at both schools.

The Middle School Connection program for incoming 6th graders has shown strong success, with nearly 600 students participating across both schools and 97% reporting the program helped prepare them for middle school. Looking ahead, District 97 plans to continue evaluating and improving these initiatives, with upcoming presentations scheduled throughout the school year on various topics including student services, social-emotional learning, and curriculum updates. These changes represent a comprehensive effort to create more responsive, challenging, and equitable learning experiences for all Oak Park middle school students.

**Oak Park School District Proposes Nashville Field Trip for Eighth Graders**

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 has announced plans for its eighth-grade class field trip to Nashville for March 14-16, 2026. The proposal, presented to the Board of Education on September 16, 2025, follows student voting where Nashville was selected by 73% of the eighth-grade class.

The protocols cover various aspects of board governance including member expectations (assuming positive intent, treating each other with respect), communication policies (board president as media spokesperson, restrictions on electronic communications), and procedures for community engagement (three-minute public comment periods, proper protocols for school visits). The document also addresses confidentiality requirements for closed sessions, social media usage guidelines, and information sharing protocols.

These protocols appear to be designed to ensure professional conduct, maintain transparency, and establish clear procedures for how Oak Park ESD 97 board members should interact with each other, district staff, and the community while fulfilling their governance responsibilities.
