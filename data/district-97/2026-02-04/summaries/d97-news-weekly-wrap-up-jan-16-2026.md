## Summary

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 has released its 2025-26 academic calendar, with the school year beginning on Wednesday, August 20, 2025, and ending on Tuesday, June 2, 2026. The district will hold teacher institute days on August 18-19, 2025, January 5, 2026, and March 17, 2026, during which schools will be closed to students.

The academic year will span 176 student attendance days organized into three trimesters of 58, 58, and 60 days respectively. Key breaks include Thanksgiving (November 26-28, 2025), Winter Break (December 22, 2025 - January 2, 2026), and Spring Break (March 30 - April 3, 2026). The district has scheduled two sets of family-teacher conferences: October 23-24, 2025, and February 12-13, 2026, with Thursday featuring full-day student attendance and evening conferences, while Friday will be staff-only with morning conferences.

Oak Park families should note that the district has built in five emergency days (June 3-9, 2026) if needed due to weather or other closures, and no planned absences should be scheduled until after these potential makeup days. The calendar also observes major holidays including Indigenous Peoples' Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, and Juneteenth, providing families with a comprehensive schedule to plan around the upcoming school year.
