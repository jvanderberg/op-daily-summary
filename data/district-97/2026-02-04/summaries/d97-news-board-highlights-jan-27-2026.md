## Summary

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 is conducting a comprehensive K-5 mathematics pilot program during the 2025-2026 school year as part of a multi-stage process to select a new math curriculum. The district's K-5 Math Curriculum Committee has been working to develop a new mission statement for mathematics education that emphasizes fostering number sense, hands-on learning, and a growth mindset while equipping students with critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that honor each learner's unique strengths.

Two schools, Holmes and Longfellow, are serving as pilot schools testing two evidence-based math resources: Amplify Desmos Math and Math Learning Center Bridges in Mathematics. These pilot teachers are receiving specialized coaching and training from November through March. Meanwhile, the six non-pilot schools (Beye, Hatch, Irving, Lincoln, Mann, and Whittier) are participating in professional development focused on research-based mathematics instruction strategies.

The pilot program aims to evaluate resources based on seven key criteria including alignment with Illinois Learning Standards, instructional approach, assessment capabilities, and cultural responsiveness. The district plans to gather feedback from teachers, students, and families, analyze assessment data, and make a recommendation to the Board of Education for curriculum adoption in April 2026. This initiative is designed to ensure all K-5 students have access to high-quality mathematics instruction that promotes equity and helps every student reach their mathematical potential.
