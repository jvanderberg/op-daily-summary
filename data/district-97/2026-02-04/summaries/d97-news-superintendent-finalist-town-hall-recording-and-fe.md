## Summary

This document outlines the Board Protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, which were established on July 27, 2021. These protocols set comprehensive guidelines for how board members should conduct themselves and interact with each other, district staff, and the community.

The protocols cover key areas including board member expectations (treating each other with respect and speaking professionally), handling community concerns through proper chains of command, and maintaining unified communication where only the board president serves as the official spokesperson to media. Important operational guidelines include maintaining confidentiality during closed sessions, being judicious with electronic communications due to Freedom of Information Act requirements, and following specific procedures for school visits and public comment periods at meetings.

These protocols establish a framework for professional governance that emphasizes accountability, transparency, and proper procedures. For Oak Park residents, this means clearer pathways for addressing concerns through appropriate district channels and more structured public participation opportunities during board meetings, with the overarching goal of ensuring effective district operations while maintaining public access and professional standards.
