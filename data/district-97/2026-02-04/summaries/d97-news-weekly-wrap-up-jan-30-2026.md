## Summary

This document outlines Oak Park Elementary School District 97's comprehensive educational transformation initiative focused on four key goals to better serve students across the district's eight elementary schools and two middle schools.

The district has announced four "Transformation Goals" that emphasize equity, excellence, and belonging: building inclusive community culture, designing instruction for all students, aligning resources strategically, and expanding learning beyond the classroom. Key initiatives include implementing a new K-5 literacy curriculum based on evidence-based reading instruction, redesigning middle school programs with better transitions and support systems, and creating the "Portrait of an Oak Park 8th Grade Graduate" framework that defines skills and qualities students should develop by graduation.

Oak Park families and residents will see impacts through new community partnerships with organizations like the Park District and Oak Park Education Foundation, enhanced safety measures through the Tri-Agency Safety Group, and more culturally responsive celebrations via the Identity and Heritage Calendar. The district is also strengthening early childhood programs and establishing a Youth Advisory Council to ensure student voices are heard in the transformation process. This comprehensive approach aims to reimagine public education while fostering creativity, social-emotional development, and a strong sense of belonging for every student.
