# School District 97 - 2026-02-04

District 97 is implementing a major transformation initiative centered on four goals: building inclusive community culture, designing instruction for all students, aligning resources strategically, and expanding learning beyond the classroom. This comprehensive effort includes launching a new K-5 literacy curriculum based on evidence-based reading instruction and redesigning middle school programs with better transitions and support systems. Families will see new community partnerships and enhanced cultural celebrations through the Identity and Heritage Calendar.

The district is currently conducting a K-5 math curriculum pilot program, with Holmes and Longfellow schools testing two potential resources: Amplify Desmos Math and Math Learning Center Bridges in Mathematics. Teachers at the six non-pilot schools are participating in professional development while pilot schools receive specialized coaching through March. The Board will make a curriculum recommendation in April 2026 based on feedback from teachers, students, and families.

Looking ahead, families should mark their calendars for a Community Conversation about student behavior support on February 25 at Brooks Middle School (RSVP required by February 13). The 2025-26 school year will run from August 20, 2025, to June 2, 2026, with family-teacher conferences scheduled for October 23-24 and February 12-13.

This document outlines Oak Park Elementary School District 97's comprehensive educational transformation initiative focused on four key goals to better serve students across the district's eight elementary schools and two middle schools.

The district has announced four "Transformation Goals" that emphasize equity, excellence, and belonging: building inclusive community culture, designing instruction for all students, aligning resources strategically, and expanding learning beyond the classroom. Key initiatives include implementing a new K-5 literacy curriculum based on evidence-based reading instruction, redesigning middle school programs with better transitions and support systems, and creating the "Portrait of an Oak Park 8th Grade Graduate" framework that defines skills and qualities students should develop by graduation.

Oak Park families and residents will see impacts through new community partnerships with organizations like the Park District and Oak Park Education Foundation, enhanced safety measures through the Tri-Agency Safety Group, and more culturally responsive celebrations via the Identity and Heritage Calendar. The district is also strengthening early childhood programs and establishing a Youth Advisory Council to ensure student voices are heard in the transformation process. This comprehensive approach aims to reimagine public education while fostering creativity, social-emotional development, and a strong sense of belonging for every student.

Oak Park Elementary School District 97 is conducting a comprehensive K-5 mathematics pilot program during the 2025-2026 school year as part of a multi-stage process to select a new math curriculum. The district's K-5 Math Curriculum Committee has been working to develop a new mission statement for mathematics education that emphasizes fostering number sense, hands-on learning, and a growth mindset while equipping students with critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that honor each learner's unique strengths.

Two schools, Holmes and Longfellow, are serving as pilot schools testing two evidence-based math resources: Amplify Desmos Math and Math Learning Center Bridges in Mathematics. These pilot teachers are receiving specialized coaching and training from November through March. Meanwhile, the six non-pilot schools (Beye, Hatch, Irving, Lincoln, Mann, and Whittier) are participating in professional development focused on research-based mathematics instruction strategies.

The pilot program aims to evaluate resources based on seven key criteria including alignment with Illinois Learning Standards, instructional approach, assessment capabilities, and cultural responsiveness. The district plans to gather feedback from teachers, students, and families, analyze assessment data, and make a recommendation to the Board of Education for curriculum adoption in April 2026. This initiative is designed to ensure all K-5 students have access to high-quality mathematics instruction that promotes equity and helps every student reach their mathematical potential.

This document outlines the Board Protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, which were established on July 27, 2021. These protocols set comprehensive guidelines for how board members should conduct themselves and interact with each other, district staff, and the community.

The protocols cover key areas including board member expectations (treating each other with respect and speaking professionally), handling community concerns through proper chains of command, and maintaining unified communication where only the board president serves as the official spokesperson to media. Important operational guidelines include maintaining confidentiality during closed sessions, being judicious with electronic communications due to Freedom of Information Act requirements, and following specific procedures for school visits and public comment periods at meetings.

These protocols establish a framework for professional governance that emphasizes accountability, transparency, and proper procedures. For Oak Park residents, this means clearer pathways for addressing concerns through appropriate district channels and more structured public participation opportunities during board meetings, with the overarching goal of ensuring effective district operations while maintaining public access and professional standards.
