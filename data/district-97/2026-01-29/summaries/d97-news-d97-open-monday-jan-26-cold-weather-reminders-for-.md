## Summary

I cannot provide a news article summary for this document, as this is not a news article. Instead, this is an internal governance document titled "Oak Park ESD 97 Board Protocols" that was established on July 27, 2021.

This document outlines the operational guidelines and expectations for Oak Park Elementary School District 97 board members. It covers various aspects of board governance including professional conduct expectations, procedures for handling community concerns, communication protocols with media and on social media, guidelines for school visits, and meeting procedures including public comment protocols.

The protocols are designed to ensure board members operate professionally, maintain confidentiality when appropriate, communicate effectively as a unified body, and follow proper procedures when interacting with district staff, students, and the community. These internal guidelines help establish clear boundaries and expectations for board member behavior and decision-making processes within the school district.
