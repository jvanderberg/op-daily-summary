## Summary

I cannot provide a news article summary for this document because it is not a news article. This appears to be an internal policy document titled "Board Protocols" from Oak Park Elementary School District 97, established on July 27, 2021.

The document outlines governance guidelines and expectations for school board members, covering areas such as professional conduct during meetings, procedures for handling community concerns, communication protocols with media, confidentiality requirements for closed sessions, social media usage guidelines, and proper procedures for school visits.

If you have an actual news article about Oak Park that you'd like me to summarize, please share that instead and I'll be happy to provide a 2-3 paragraph summary focusing on the main announcement, key details, and impact on residents.
