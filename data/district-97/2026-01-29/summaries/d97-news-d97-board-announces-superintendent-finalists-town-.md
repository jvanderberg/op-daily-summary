## Summary

This document is not a news article but rather a set of board protocols established by Oak Park Elementary School District 97 on July 27, 2021. The protocols outline behavioral guidelines and procedures for school board members in their official duties.

The protocols cover several key areas including board member expectations for respectful conduct, procedures for handling community concerns through proper channels, rules for electronic communication and social media use, and guidelines for school visits. The document emphasizes that board members should speak with "one voice," maintain confidentiality during closed sessions, and follow a "no surprises" policy with the superintendent. It also establishes that only the board president can speak on behalf of the board to media, and outlines specific procedures for public comment during board meetings with a 3-minute time limit for speakers.

These protocols appear designed to ensure professional conduct, maintain transparency while protecting confidential information, and establish clear communication channels between the board, administration, and community members in Oak Park's elementary school district.
