## Summary

I cannot provide a summary of this document as it is not a news article. This appears to be an internal governance document outlining protocols and expectations for Oak Park Elementary School District 97 board members, established on July 27, 2021.

The document covers various operational guidelines including board member conduct, communication procedures, media relations, social media usage, meeting protocols, and school visitation policies. While this may be of interest to Oak Park residents who want to understand how their school board operates, it is not a news announcement or current event that would typically be summarized in news format.

If you have an actual news article about Oak Park that you'd like me to summarize, please feel free to share that instead.
