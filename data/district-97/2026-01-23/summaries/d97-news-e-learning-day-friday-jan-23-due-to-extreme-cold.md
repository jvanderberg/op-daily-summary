## Summary

This document outlines board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, establishing guidelines for board member conduct and operations that were put in place on July 27, 2021.

The protocols cover key areas including board member expectations (treating each other with respect and assuming positive intent), procedures for handling community concerns through proper chains of command, and communication standards. Board members are required to speak with "one voice," with only the board president authorized to speak on behalf of the board to media. The document also establishes strict confidentiality rules for closed sessions and guidelines for electronic communication and social media use, emphasizing that most communications are subject to public records laws.

These protocols aim to ensure professional conduct and effective governance for Oak Park ESD 97. The guidelines establish clear procedures for public comment during board meetings (3-minute time limits), school visits by board members (requiring superintendent notification), and a "no surprises" policy requiring transparency between the superintendent and board members. The protocols serve as a framework to help board members fulfill their duties while maintaining appropriate boundaries and professional standards in their service to the Oak Park school community.
