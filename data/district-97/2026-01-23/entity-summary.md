# School District 97 - 2026-01-23

I notice there's a mismatch between your item titles and the content you've provided. Both items appear to be the same internal governance document for School District 97's Board of Education protocols from July 27, 2021, rather than information about a superintendent town hall or an e-learning day.

Since this is an administrative document outlining board member behavioral guidelines and procedures rather than current news or events, there isn't actionable information for Oak Park residents to summarize. The document establishes internal operating procedures for how board members should conduct themselves, communicate with the public, and handle various situations - but it doesn't announce any upcoming events, decisions, or actions that would directly impact families in the district.

If you have the actual content about the January 29 superintendent town hall or the January 23 e-learning day, I'd be happy to provide a conversational summary of those events for District 97 families.

I apologize, but this document appears to be internal governance protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97's Board of Education rather than a news article. This is an administrative document that outlines behavioral expectations and procedures for board members, including guidelines for communication, public engagement, and meeting conduct.

The document establishes protocols covering areas such as board member interactions, handling community concerns, media communication, confidentiality requirements, social media usage, and school visit procedures. These protocols were established on July 27, 2021, and serve as internal operating guidelines for the school board rather than a public announcement or news event.

Since this is not a news article about a specific event or announcement, there isn't information about immediate impact on Oak Park residents to summarize in the traditional news format you requested.

### E-Learning Day Friday, Jan. 23 Due to Extreme Cold

This document outlines board protocols for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, establishing guidelines for board member conduct and operations that were put in place on July 27, 2021.

The protocols cover key areas including board member expectations (treating each other with respect and assuming positive intent), procedures for handling community concerns through proper chains of command, and communication standards. Board members are required to speak with "one voice," with only the board president authorized to speak on behalf of the board to media. The document also establishes strict confidentiality rules for closed sessions and guidelines for electronic communication and social media use, emphasizing that most communications are subject to public records laws.

These protocols aim to ensure professional conduct and effective governance for Oak Park ESD 97. The guidelines establish clear procedures for public comment during board meetings (3-minute time limits), school visits by board members (requiring superintendent notification), and a "no surprises" policy requiring transparency between the superintendent and board members. The protocols serve as a framework to help board members fulfill their duties while maintaining appropriate boundaries and professional standards in their service to the Oak Park school community.
