# Oak Park Government Daily Summary - 2026-02-04

The Village of Oak Park earned major environmental recognition this week, becoming the only Illinois municipality to receive an 'A' score from the global nonprofit CDP in 2025. The Village also released its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest rate increases for services like water and refuse collection.

More immediately relevant for residents: free flu and COVID-19 rapid tests are available at Village Hall's Welcome Center during business hours as respiratory illnesses hit their highest levels nationally in over two decades. The Village is also urging residents to register for their new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme - you'll need to create a new account since they switched to a different platform.

Oak Park property owners get some breathing room this tax season. Thanks to lobbying efforts by Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar, first installment property tax bills won't arrive until early March with an April 1st due date instead of the usual February-March timeline. The delay comes after Cook County's computer problems last year created an unusually tight gap between tax payments.

The Park District is asking voters to approve a $40 million bond for a new indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common. The March 17 referendum would fund a facility with lap pools, therapy pools, and an indoor splash pad. Owners of a $430,000 home would see taxes increase by about $160 annually. Information sessions are scheduled for January 22, February 4, and February 25 at the Community Recreation Center.

School District 97 is piloting two potential new K-5 math curricula at Holmes and Longfellow schools through March, with a Board decision coming in April 2026. All juniors at Oak Park High School must attend mandatory post-secondary planning meetings February 10-11 with their counselors to discuss college, career, and other options after graduation.

The library hired its first Civic Literacy Librarian, Simon Czerwinskyj, who's organizing election prep programs including a tax bill explanation session with Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi on February 5.

## Village of Oak Park

The Village of Oak Park is taking several steps to address public health needs this winter. During American Heart Month in February, the health department is encouraging residents to use the free indoor track at the Community Recreation Center and offering presentations on heart disease prevention. More immediately, free flu and COVID-19 rapid tests are available at Village Hall's Welcome Center during business hours as respiratory illnesses reach their highest levels nationally in over two decades.

Oak Park achieved significant recognition for environmental leadership, earning an 'A' score from the global nonprofit CDP - making it the only Illinois municipality to receive this distinction in 2025. The Village also released its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest rate increases for services like refuse collection and water. Meanwhile, winter tree pruning is underway in central Oak Park areas, with residents asked to move vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted.

The Village is moving forward with acquiring the U.S. Bank property at 11 Madison Street for a new police station through eminent domain after unsuccessful negotiations. Officials cited the bank's pattern of closing five Oak Park branches since 2014 as evidence of their withdrawal from the community. Residents also need to register for the new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme, as the Village has switched to an Everbridge platform that requires new accounts for continued notifications.

## Oak Park Township

Oak Park Township property owners will get an extra month to pay their first installment tax bills this year. Instead of receiving bills on February 1st with a March 1st due date, residents won't get their bills until early March and won't need to pay until April 1st, 2025.

This one-time delay stems from problems with Cook County's computer system last year that pushed second installment bills back to December 15th, creating an unusually short gap between tax payments. Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar worked with other township assessors to lobby the state legislature for relief, arguing that the compressed timeline would create financial hardship for residents.

The Illinois legislature unanimously approved the extension during their fall session, working until 3:30 AM on the final day to pass the measure. This gives all Oak Park property owners additional breathing room between their tax obligations.

## School District 97

District 97 is implementing a major transformation initiative centered on four goals: building inclusive community culture, designing instruction for all students, aligning resources strategically, and expanding learning beyond the classroom. This comprehensive effort includes launching a new K-5 literacy curriculum based on evidence-based reading instruction and redesigning middle school programs with better transitions and support systems. Families will see new community partnerships and enhanced cultural celebrations through the Identity and Heritage Calendar.

The district is currently conducting a K-5 math curriculum pilot program, with Holmes and Longfellow schools testing two potential resources: Amplify Desmos Math and Math Learning Center Bridges in Mathematics. Teachers at the six non-pilot schools are participating in professional development while pilot schools receive specialized coaching through March. The Board will make a curriculum recommendation in April 2026 based on feedback from teachers, students, and families.

Looking ahead, families should mark their calendars for a Community Conversation about student behavior support on February 25 at Brooks Middle School (RSVP required by February 13). The 2025-26 school year will run from August 20, 2025, to June 2, 2026, with family-teacher conferences scheduled for October 23-24 and February 12-13.

## OPRF High School District 200

Oak Park High School has two important events coming up for students planning their futures beyond graduation. All juniors are required to attend mandatory Post-Secondary Planning Meetings on February 10-11, 2026, where school counselors will guide students and families through college options, career paths, apprenticeships, and other alternatives after high school. Students must attend their assigned counselor's session during this two-day period.

Additionally, the school is hosting Black Professionals Day on February 17 from 8:50-10:50 a.m. in the Auditorium, featuring professional panels, breakout sessions, and networking opportunities to help students learn about career success. All students can participate, but must register by February 16. Both events are designed to help Oak Park students make informed decisions about their post-graduation plans during this crucial junior year period.

## Park District of Oak Park

The Park District of Oak Park is bringing a major investment decision to residents with a $40 million bond referendum for an indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common. The March 17, 2026 ballot measure would fund a new facility featuring a 6-8 lane lap pool, warm-water therapy pool, indoor splash pad with slides, and updated amenities. If approved, homeowners with a $430,000 property would see their taxes increase by about $160 annually. The district is hosting community information sessions at 7 p.m. on January 22, February 4, and February 25 at the Community Recreation Center, with childcare available for those who RSVP.

Looking ahead to later in 2026, residents will have multiple opportunities to shape the future of their neighborhood parks. The district will hold community planning meetings for the Oak Park Conservatory (May 13), Rehm Park (October 14), and Euclid Square Park (November 4). These sessions are part of the district's commitment to update each park's development plan every 10 years and help identify desired improvements while preparing strategic budgets for potential grant opportunities.

The district has been earning significant recognition for its operations and safety standards. Oak Park received the prestigious 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, placing it among the top 10% of aquatic facilities nationwide, and earned both state and national accreditation for its overall park and recreation services. These achievements demonstrate the district's commitment to professional excellence and community safety.

## Oak Park Public Library

The Oak Park Public Library has hired Simon Czerwinskyj as its first Civic Literacy Librarian, who is organizing several timely programs to help residents prepare for the March 17 Gubernatorial Primary Election. Upcoming events include a tax bill explanation session with Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi on February 5, discussions about AI and data centers on February 21, and a virtual news media literacy workshop on March 31. Czerwinskyj has also created a comprehensive guide with nine steps to help residents spot misinformation and disinformation, emphasizing the importance of checking source credibility, reading beyond headlines, and examining personal biases when consuming news.

February brings extensive Black History Month programming, including two major exhibits: "Dreamscapes by Amani Borah" featuring colorful works depicting life in Kenya, and "Maintaining Wonder: Deangelo & the Dandelion," an immersive installation exploring a creative Black child's interior life. The library is also hosting storytelling with Mama Edie McLoud Armstrong, who marched with Dr. King, and multiple Rapbrary events featuring live performance and film screenings.

The library has launched its "Six in 2026" reading initiative, encouraging residents to read just six minutes daily based on University of Sussex research showing this can significantly reduce stress. New digital offerings include hoopla's BingePass, which gives library cardholders seven days of unlimited streaming access to premium content from providers like BBC, PBS Kids, and The Great Courses. The library is also hosting its 16th Annual Oscarthon movie marathon on March 7 and 14, featuring Oscar-nominated films with free popcorn and raffle prizes.
