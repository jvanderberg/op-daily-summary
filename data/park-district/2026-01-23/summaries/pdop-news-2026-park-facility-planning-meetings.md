## Summary

The Oak Park Park District has announced a series of 2026 Park & Facility Planning Review meetings as part of their ongoing commitment to improving community recreational spaces. These meetings are part of the district's policy to revisit and update each park site plan within a 10-year period to identify desired amenities, plan strategic budgets, and prepare for grant opportunities.

The community is invited to attend three scheduled planning meetings: Oak Park Conservatory on May 13, Rehm Park on October 14, and Euclid Square Park on November 4. Specific details about meeting locations and times will be made available through the district's website, social media channels, and email newsletters as the dates approach.

These planning sessions represent an opportunity for Oak Park residents to provide input on future park improvements and help shape the development of their community's recreational facilities. The meetings are part of the Park District's broader mission to maintain and enhance parks and facilities based on community needs and interests.
