## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has achieved a significant milestone by earning national accreditation through the Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies (CAPRA) and the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA). This distinguished accomplishment was announced during the 2025 NRPA Annual Conference in Orlando, Florida on October 21, 2025.

CAPRA accreditation is the only national accreditation available for park and recreation agencies and represents the highest standard of quality in operation, management, and community service. To earn this recognition, the Park District had to demonstrate compliance with 154 rigorous standards and document all policies and procedures through a comprehensive process that included formal applications, self-assessments, a site visit by trained volunteers, and a hearing with the Commission.

This accreditation places Oak Park among an elite group of park and recreation agencies nationally and internationally, recognizing their commitment to excellence in serving the community's 54,000 residents. The Park District operates 18 parks totaling 84 acres, multiple recreation centers, pools, and facilities, offering nearly 8,000 programs and special events annually. The accreditation process often helps agencies identify efficiencies and improve accountability, ultimately translating into higher quality services for Oak Park residents.
