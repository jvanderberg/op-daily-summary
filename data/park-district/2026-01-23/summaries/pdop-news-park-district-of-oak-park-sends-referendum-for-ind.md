## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has announced it will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 general primary election ballot, asking residents to approve funding for an indoor aquatics facility at the Ridgeland Common Recreation Complex. The Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to put this decision to a public vote, citing growing community support that reached over 60% in their 2023 Community Survey.

The proposed facility would include a 25-yard lap pool with 6-8 lanes, a warm-water therapy and recreation pool, an indoor splash pad with slides, new locker rooms, an updated lobby, and additional program space. If approved, the current outdoor pool at Ridgeland Common would be closed to accommodate the new indoor addition. The project would be funded through 20-year general obligation bonds, resulting in a tax increase of approximately $13.36 per month ($160.30 annually) for a home valued at $430,000.

Oak Park residents can learn more about the proposal at three community information sessions scheduled for January 22, February 4, and February 25, all at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center. The Park District emphasizes that without referendum approval, the indoor aquatic facility will not be built, making this a critical community decision for the district's 54,000 residents.
