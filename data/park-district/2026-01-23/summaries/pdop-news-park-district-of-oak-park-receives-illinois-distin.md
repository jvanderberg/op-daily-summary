## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has been recognized as an Illinois Distinguished Accredited Agency by the Illinois Association of Park Districts (IAPD) and the Illinois Park and Recreation Association (IPRA). The district received this prestigious award in November 2025, earning more than a perfect score due to extra credit opportunities during the comprehensive evaluation process.

To achieve this recognition, the Park District underwent a detailed evaluation administered by a Joint Distinguished Park and Recreation Accreditation Committee. The process included submitting a self-evaluation, receiving mentorship, and presenting documentation and facility tours to an evaluation team. The team reviewed various aspects including general management procedures, finance and business operations, facilities and parks, personnel, recreation services, and legal documentation.

This accreditation demonstrates that Oak Park's park district meets established professional standards for delivering exceptional park and recreation services. The recognition benefits the community by ensuring residents can have confidence that their park district employs qualified professionals and maintains high operational standards. The district, which serves 54,000 Oak Park residents through 18 parks and various recreation facilities, will be reevaluated in six years to maintain its accredited status.
