# Park District of Oak Park - 2026-01-23

The Park District of Oak Park is preparing for significant community engagement in 2026, starting with three park planning meetings where residents can help shape improvements at Oak Park Conservatory (May 13), Rehm Park (October 14), and Euclid Square Park (November 4). These sessions are part of the district's policy to review each park every 10 years and will help identify needed amenities and prepare for future grant opportunities.

The district has earned impressive recognition for its operations and safety standards. Their aquatics team received the 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, placing them among the top 10% nationally with audit scores of 97.78% or higher. They've also achieved both state and national accreditation - earning Illinois Distinguished Accredited Agency status from IAPD/IPRA and becoming nationally accredited through CAPRA, joining an elite group that meets 154 rigorous operational standards.

Most significantly for residents, the Park District will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 ballot to fund an indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common. The proposed facility would include lap pools, a therapy pool, and an indoor splash pad, funded through 20-year bonds that would cost homeowners about $13.36 monthly ($160 annually for a $430,000 home). Three community information sessions are scheduled for January 22, February 4, and February 25 at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center for residents to learn more before voting.

The Park District of Oak Park has announced it will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 general primary election ballot, asking residents to approve funding for an indoor aquatics facility at the Ridgeland Common Recreation Complex. The Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to put this decision to a public vote, citing growing community support that reached over 60% in their 2023 Community Survey.

The proposed facility would include a 25-yard lap pool with 6-8 lanes, a warm-water therapy and recreation pool, an indoor splash pad with slides, new locker rooms, an updated lobby, and additional program space. If approved, the current outdoor pool at Ridgeland Common would be closed to accommodate the new indoor addition. The project would be funded through 20-year general obligation bonds, resulting in a tax increase of approximately $13.36 per month ($160.30 annually) for a home valued at $430,000.

Oak Park residents can learn more about the proposal at three community information sessions scheduled for January 22, February 4, and February 25, all at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center. The Park District emphasizes that without referendum approval, the indoor aquatic facility will not be built, making this a critical community decision for the district's 54,000 residents.
