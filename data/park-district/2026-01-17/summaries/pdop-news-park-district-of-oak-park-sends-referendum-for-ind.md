## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park announced it will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 primary election ballot, asking residents to approve funding for an indoor aquatics facility at the Ridgeland Common Recreation Complex. The Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to put this decision to a public vote after community surveys showed growing support for year-round aquatic opportunities, reaching over 60% support in 2023.

The proposed facility would include a 25-yard lap pool with 6-8 lanes, a warm-water therapy and fitness pool, an indoor splash pad with slides, new locker rooms, an updated lobby, and additional program space. If approved, the current outdoor pool at Ridgeland Common would be closed to accommodate the new indoor addition. The project would be funded through 20-year general obligation bonds, resulting in a tax increase of approximately $13.36 per month ($160.30 annually) for a home valued at $430,000.

The Park District will hold three community information sessions at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center on January 22, February 4, and February 25, with childcare available for attendees who RSVP. Without referendum approval, the indoor aquatic facility will not be built, as available Park District funds cannot cover the total construction cost.
