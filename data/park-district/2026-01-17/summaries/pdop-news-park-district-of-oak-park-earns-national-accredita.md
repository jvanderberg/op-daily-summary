## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has achieved a significant milestone by earning national accreditation through the Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies (CAPRA) and the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA). This distinguished accomplishment was announced during the 2025 NRPA Annual Conference in Orlando, Florida on October 21, 2025.

CAPRA accreditation is the only national accreditation available for park and recreation agencies and represents the highest standard of quality in operation, management, and community service. To earn this recognition, the Park District had to demonstrate compliance with 154 rigorous standards covering areas such as management, administration of facilities and lands, programs, safety protocols, and community services. The comprehensive accreditation process included formal applications, self-assessments, a site visit by trained volunteers, and a formal hearing with the Commission.

This achievement places Oak Park's Park District among an elite group of park and recreation agencies nationwide and internationally. The accreditation process helps agencies identify operational efficiencies and strengthen accountability measures, ultimately resulting in higher quality services for the community. The Park District serves Oak Park's 54,000 residents through 8,000 annual programs and events across 18 parks, recreation centers, pools, and historic facilities.
