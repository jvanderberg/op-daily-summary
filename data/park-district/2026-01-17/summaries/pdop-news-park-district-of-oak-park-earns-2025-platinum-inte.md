## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has been honored with the 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, a prestigious recognition given to only the top 10 percent of aquatic safety teams that exceed industry standards for risk management and aquatic safety. The award is presented by Ellis & Associates, which is recognized as the global leader in aquatic safety and risk management.

To earn this platinum-level recognition, the Oak Park aquatics team had to achieve exceptional performance across multiple criteria. They were required to score 97.78% or higher on all lifeguard observations, supervisor observations, and VAT (Visual Auditory Test) observations, while also achieving "Exceed Industry Standards" ratings on all audit scores. Ellis & Associates validates these high standards through three rigorous audits each summer, including unannounced site visits and live-action rescue drills and simulations.

This achievement reflects the Oak Park aquatics team's exceptional commitment to safety and their ability to deliver outstanding service during the summer season. For Oak Park residents, this award provides assurance that their local aquatic facilities maintain the highest safety standards and that lifeguards are exceptionally well-trained to handle emergency situations.
