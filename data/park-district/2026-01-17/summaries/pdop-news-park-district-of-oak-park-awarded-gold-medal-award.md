## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has been awarded the prestigious Grand Plaque in the 2025 National Gold Medal Awards for Excellence in Park and Recreation Management, marking the third time in the district's history it has received this top national honor. The award was presented on September 17 at the National Recreation and Parks Association's national conference in Orlando, Florida. The district previously won this award in 1966 (the inaugural year) and 2015, and has been recognized as a national finalist for five consecutive years.

The Gold Medal Award, presented by the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration in partnership with the National Recreation and Park Association, recognizes agencies that demonstrate excellence in vision, innovation, environmental stewardship, programming, and community service. The Park District of Oak Park competed in Class IV, representing communities with populations of 30,001 to 75,000, and underwent a rigorous review process including submission of a five-minute video and evaluation of their comprehensive and strategic plans by a panel of five park and recreation professionals.

This recognition highlights the district's commitment to serving Oak Park's 54,000 residents through nearly 8,000 programs and special events annually across 18 parks totaling 84 acres, multiple recreation centers, pools, and specialized facilities like the Oak Park Conservatory and Cheney Mansion. The achievement reflects the collaborative efforts of community members, staff, volunteers, and commissioners in maintaining Oak Park's reputation as a national leader in parks and recreation management.
