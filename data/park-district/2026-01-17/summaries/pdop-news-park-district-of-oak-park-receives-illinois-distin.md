## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has been honored with the Illinois Distinguished Accredited Agency Award by the Illinois Association of Park Districts (IAPD) and the Illinois Park and Recreation Association (IPRA). The award, announced on October 21, 2025, recognizes agencies that demonstrate exceptional standards in delivering park and recreation services through a comprehensive voluntary evaluation process.

To achieve this distinction, the Park District underwent a detailed application and evaluation process overseen by a Joint Distinguished Park and Recreation Accreditation Committee. The evaluation included a thorough review of the agency's management procedures, finances, facilities, personnel, recreation services, and legal documentation, along with facility tours. The Park District received more than a perfect score due to extra credit opportunities and was officially approved for Distinguished Accredited status in November 2025.

This recognition highlights the Park District's commitment to serving Oak Park's 54,000 residents through nearly 8,000 annual programs and events across 18 parks, recreation centers, pools, and historic facilities like the Oak Park Conservatory and Cheney Mansion. The accreditation assures residents that their park district employs qualified professionals and meets established professional standards, with a reevaluation scheduled in six years to maintain the certification.
