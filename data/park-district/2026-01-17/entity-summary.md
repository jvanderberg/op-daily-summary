# Park District of Oak Park - 2026-01-17

The Park District of Oak Park has received multiple prestigious national and state awards in 2025, establishing itself as a leader in parks and recreation management. Most notably, the district won the National Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Park and Recreation Management for the third time in its history, competing against agencies serving similar-sized communities. The district also earned both state and national accreditation, including the Illinois Distinguished Accredited Agency Award and national CAPRA accreditation through the National Recreation and Park Association - recognition that only the highest-performing agencies achieve.

The district's aquatics program earned the 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, given only to the top 10% of aquatic safety teams nationwide. To qualify, Oak Park's lifeguards had to score 97.78% or higher on all safety observations and achieve "Exceed Industry Standards" ratings on three rigorous summer audits, including unannounced rescue drills.

Looking ahead, residents will vote on a $40 million referendum for an indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common on the March 17, 2026 primary ballot. The proposed facility would include a lap pool, therapy pool, indoor splash pad, and updated amenities, funded through 20-year bonds costing approximately $160 annually for a $430,000 home. The Park District is hosting community information sessions on January 22, February 4, and February 25 at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center, with childcare available for those who RSVP.

The Park District of Oak Park has been honored with the 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, a prestigious recognition given to only the top 10 percent of aquatic safety teams that exceed industry standards for risk management and aquatic safety. The award is presented by Ellis & Associates, which is recognized as the global leader in aquatic safety and risk management.

To earn this platinum-level recognition, the Oak Park aquatics team had to achieve exceptional performance across multiple criteria. They were required to score 97.78% or higher on all lifeguard observations, supervisor observations, and VAT (Visual Auditory Test) observations, while also achieving "Exceed Industry Standards" ratings on all audit scores. Ellis & Associates validates these high standards through three rigorous audits each summer, including unannounced site visits and live-action rescue drills and simulations.

This achievement reflects the Oak Park aquatics team's exceptional commitment to safety and their ability to deliver outstanding service during the summer season. For Oak Park residents, this award provides assurance that their local aquatic facilities maintain the highest safety standards and that lifeguards are exceptionally well-trained to handle emergency situations.

- **Date:** December 19, 2025

The Park District of Oak Park announced it will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 primary election ballot, asking residents to approve funding for an indoor aquatics facility at the Ridgeland Common Recreation Complex. The Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to put this decision to a public vote after community surveys showed growing support for year-round aquatic opportunities, reaching over 60% support in 2023.

The proposed facility would include a 25-yard lap pool with 6-8 lanes, a warm-water therapy and fitness pool, an indoor splash pad with slides, new locker rooms, an updated lobby, and additional program space. If approved, the current outdoor pool at Ridgeland Common would be closed to accommodate the new indoor addition. The project would be funded through 20-year general obligation bonds, resulting in a tax increase of approximately $13.36 per month ($160.30 annually) for a home valued at $430,000.

The Park District will hold three community information sessions at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center on January 22, February 4, and February 25, with childcare available for attendees who RSVP. Without referendum approval, the indoor aquatic facility will not be built, as available Park District funds cannot cover the total construction cost.
