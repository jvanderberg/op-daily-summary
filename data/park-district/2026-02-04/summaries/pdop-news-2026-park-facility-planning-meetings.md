## Summary

The Oak Park Park District has announced three upcoming community planning meetings in 2026 as part of their ongoing park and facility planning process. The meetings will focus on the Oak Park Conservatory (May 13), Rehm Park (October 14), and Euclid Square Park (November 4). These meetings are open to all Oak Park community members who want to participate in planning future park improvements.

The planning sessions are part of the Park District's policy to revisit and update each park site plan within a 10-year period. The goal is to identify new park amenities that residents desire, develop strategic budgets for improvements, and prepare for potential grant opportunities. Specific details about meeting locations and times will be shared through the Park District's website, social media channels, and email newsletters as the dates approach.

This community engagement initiative allows Oak Park residents to have direct input on the future development of their local parks and recreational facilities, ensuring that improvements align with community needs and preferences.
