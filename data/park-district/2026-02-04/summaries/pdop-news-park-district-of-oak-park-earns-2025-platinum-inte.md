## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has been awarded the prestigious 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, recognizing it among the top 10% of aquatic safety teams nationwide. This honor, presented by Ellis & Associates (the global leader in aquatic safety and risk management), acknowledges facilities that exceed industry standards for risk management and aquatic safety protocols.

To earn this platinum-level recognition, the Park District had to achieve exceptional scores across multiple criteria, including scoring 97.78% or higher on all lifeguard observations, supervisor observations, and VAT observations during three unannounced summer audits.

The recognition highlights the Park District's commitment to providing safe swimming and water recreation opportunities, giving families confidence in the quality and safety of local aquatic programs and facilities.
