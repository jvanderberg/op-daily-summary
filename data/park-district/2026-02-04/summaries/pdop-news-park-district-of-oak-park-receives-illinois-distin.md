## Summary

The Park District of Oak Park has been honored with the Illinois Distinguished Accredited Agency Award by the Illinois Association of Park Districts (IAPD) and the Illinois Park and Recreation Association (IPRA). This prestigious recognition is part of a statewide program designed to improve park and recreation services delivery throughout Illinois by evaluating agencies against established standards for exceptional service.

The accreditation process involves a comprehensive evaluation where agencies must submit self-evaluations, undergo mentorship, and present detailed documentation covering management procedures, finances, facilities, personnel, recreation services, and legal compliance. An evaluation team conducts site visits and facility tours before making their determination. The Park District of Oak Park was approved for this distinguished status in November 2025, earning more than a perfect score due to extra credit opportunities.

This achievement demonstrates Oak Park's commitment to providing high-quality recreation services to its 54,000 residents through nearly 8,000 annual programs across 18 parks, recreation centers, pools, and historic facilities like the Oak Park Conservatory and Cheney Mansion. The accreditation gives residents confidence that their park district employs qualified professionals and meets industry standards, while also improving operational efficiency for the organization. The district will be reevaluated in six years to maintain this distinguished status.
