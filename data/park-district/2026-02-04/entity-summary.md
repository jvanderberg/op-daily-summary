# Park District of Oak Park - 2026-02-04

The Park District of Oak Park is bringing a major investment decision to residents with a $40 million bond referendum for an indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common. The March 17, 2026 ballot measure would fund a new facility featuring a 6-8 lane lap pool, warm-water therapy pool, indoor splash pad with slides, and updated amenities. If approved, homeowners with a $430,000 property would see their taxes increase by about $160 annually. The district is hosting community information sessions at 7 p.m. on January 22, February 4, and February 25 at the Community Recreation Center, with childcare available for those who RSVP.

Looking ahead to later in 2026, residents will have multiple opportunities to shape the future of their neighborhood parks. The district will hold community planning meetings for the Oak Park Conservatory (May 13), Rehm Park (October 14), and Euclid Square Park (November 4). These sessions are part of the district's commitment to update each park's development plan every 10 years and help identify desired improvements while preparing strategic budgets for potential grant opportunities.

The district has been earning significant recognition for its operations and safety standards. Oak Park received the prestigious 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, placing it among the top 10% of aquatic facilities nationwide, and earned both state and national accreditation for its overall park and recreation services. These achievements demonstrate the district's commitment to professional excellence and community safety.

- **Date:** December 19, 2025

The Park District of Oak Park has announced it will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 general primary election ballot, asking residents to approve funding for an indoor aquatics facility at the Ridgeland Common Recreation Complex. The Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to put this decision to public vote, citing growing community interest with over 60% support for year-round aquatic opportunities expressed in the 2023 Community Survey.

The proposed indoor facility would include a 25-yard lap pool (6-8 lanes), a warm-water pool for therapy and recreation, an indoor splash pad with slides, new locker rooms, an updated lobby, and additional program space. If approved, the outdoor pool at Ridgeland Common would be closed to accommodate the new indoor addition. The project would be funded through 20-year general obligation bonds, resulting in a tax increase of approximately $13.36 per month ($160.30 annually) for a home valued at $430,000.

The Park District will host three community information sessions at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center on January 22, February 4, and February 25, with childcare available for attendees who RSVP. Without referendum approval, the indoor aquatics facility will not be built, as available district funds cannot cover the total construction cost.
