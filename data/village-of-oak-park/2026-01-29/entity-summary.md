# Village of Oak Park - 2026-01-29

Oak Park celebrated its top property improvements at the 2025 Cavalcade of Pride Awards, recognizing six residential properties and several commercial properties for exceptional upgrades that enhance the village's architectural character. The awards highlight residents' ongoing investment in maintaining Oak Park's distinctive neighborhoods.

The Village is taking action on several fronts to keep residents safe and informed. Free flu and COVID-19 combination tests are available at Village Hall during business hours as flu cases spike nationwide to their highest levels in over two decades. With dangerous cold weather hitting the area, the Public Library branches are serving as warming centers, and officials urge residents to check on neighbors while following safety guidelines like layering clothing and protecting pipes from freezing.

Oak Park achieved significant recognition by earning an 'A' score from CDP, making it the only Illinois municipality on the organization's 2025 environmental leadership list. The Village also approved its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest increases in utility rates - refuse collection will rise to about $31 monthly for 96-gallon carts, while water and sewer rates increase slightly. Residents need to register for the new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme, as the Village has switched to a new Everbridge platform that allows customized notification preferences.

The Village of Oak Park has issued cold weather safety guidance as dangerously cold temperatures strike the area. Officials are urging residents to limit outdoor time for themselves and pets, and to check on friends and neighbors who may need assistance. The Oak Park Public Library's three branches are serving as warming centers during regular operating hours, and additional warming center information is available through Cook County's Department of Emergency Management and Chicago's city resources.

The village has provided comprehensive safety recommendations including dressing in multiple loose layers, wearing proper headwear and mittens, avoiding overexertion like heavy snow shoveling, and staying hydrated with warm liquids while avoiding alcohol and caffeine. Officials also emphasize the importance of protecting pipes from freezing by maintaining home temperatures above 55 degrees, opening cabinet doors around pipes, and letting faucets trickle cold water.

Additional safety measures include never using stoves, ovens, or fuel-burning devices indoors for heating due to carbon monoxide risks, ensuring space heaters are used safely on hard surfaces away from flammable materials, and avoiding travel during extreme weather. For those who must drive, the village recommends keeping emergency supplies like blankets, flashlights, and snacks in vehicles, along with ensuring cell phones are charged and informing others of travel plans.

The Oak Park Public Health Department is offering free flu/COVID combination rapid tests to residents at Village Hall in response to a significant spike in influenza cases nationwide. According to public health officials, hospital admissions for flu-like illnesses have reached their highest levels in more than two decades this season, prompting the local health department to take proactive measures.

Residents experiencing flu-like symptoms—including fever, dry cough, breathing difficulties, fatigue, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, or headaches—can pick up free tests at Village Hall (123 Madison St.) during regular business hours, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The tests are available at the Welcome Center on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last, and residents are encouraged to call the Health Department at 708.358.5480 or email health@oak-park.us to confirm availability before visiting.

This initiative provides Oak Park residents with convenient access to testing during a time of heightened respiratory illness activity, helping them quickly determine if they have contracted flu or COVID-19 and take appropriate health precautions.

### Official Statement from the Village of Oak Park on U.S. Bank

- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Official-Statement-from-the-Village-of-Oak-Park-on-U.S.-Bank

The Village of Oak Park announced it will proceed with acquiring U.S. Bank's property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain using "quick-take" powers for a new police station. Following a public hearing on January 13, 2026, the Village confirmed that negotiations with U.S. Bank for a voluntary sale were unsuccessful, despite the Village's offers to help the bank find a new location within Oak Park. The bank had listed the property in February 2025 and indicated it could vacate as soon as 24 months after acquisition.

The Village's decision comes amid U.S. Bank's pattern of closing branches in Oak Park and the surrounding area. Since 2014, the bank has closed five locations in or near the Village, including branches on South Oak Park Avenue, Roosevelt Road, North Avenue, and most recently in 2025, locations on North Oak Park Avenue and in Chicago's neighboring Austin area. This trend aligns with U.S. Bank's broader strategy of closing 40 brick-and-mortar locations across 17 states in 2025.

Village officials emphasized that the police station project is critical for public safety and that 11 Madison Street is ideal for adaptive reuse. While the Village remains open to helping U.S. Bank find alternative locations within Oak Park, officials stated they will not allow banking concerns to compromise this essential public safety infrastructure project.

### Oak Park achieves CDP ‘A’ score for environmental leadership

Oak Park has earned a prestigious 'A' score from CDP, a global environmental non-profit organization, placing it on CDP's annual 'A' List for environmental leadership. This recognition comes through CDP's independent environmental disclosure system, which tracks data from over 1,000 cities, states and regions worldwide. Oak Park is notably the only municipality in Illinois to receive this distinction in 2025.

To achieve the 'A' score, Oak Park met rigorous criteria including publicly disclosing environmental data, maintaining comprehensive city-wide emissions inventory, publishing a credible climate action plan, and completing full climate risk assessments. The achievement reflects the community's work on "Climate Ready Oak Park," their comprehensive sustainability and resilience plan. Chief Sustainability Officer Lindsey Roland Nieratka emphasized that this recognition reflects the entire community's commitment to building a sustainable future and will energize continued progress on bold climate initiatives that protect the environment and enhance resident well-being.

### Residents urged to sign up for emergency alerts on new platform

- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Sign-up-for-emergency-alerts-on-new-platform

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts at www.oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications. The system allows users to customize their notification preferences, choosing between text, email, and voice messages, as well as selecting specific types of alerts they want to receive and adding addresses for geographically targeted notifications.

Residents who were previously enrolled in the old system will receive prompts to set up new accounts, while those who no longer wish to receive notifications can simply take no action. The Village uses the system sparingly for important alerts including severe weather warnings, snow emergency parking notifications, and mosquito spraying announcements. The Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract, resulting in savings for the Village's Public Health Department, which manages emergency preparedness for the community.

### Make way for winter tree pruning
- **Type:** news
- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Make-way-for-winter-tree-pruning

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program for 2026, targeting a portion of the community's 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle pruning in the central section of Oak Park, covering areas between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. The Village's Forestry Division will focus on younger trees in the northern section, including areas between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

The pruning follows industry best practices and addresses tree health, resident safety, and property protection by removing dead or dying limbs, raising tree canopies for safe traffic flow, and creating proper clearances around structures. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually. Residents are asked to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to ensure crews can work safely and efficiently.

This systematic approach has proven effective in minimizing storm damage and reducing ongoing pruning requests throughout Oak Park. Residents with questions or concerns about the pruning work can contact the Public Works department at 708.358.5700 or email publicworks@oak-park.us, with additional tree care information available at www.oak-park.us/trees.

### Holiday tree collection set for early January
- **Type:** news
- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Holiday-tree-collection-set-for-early-January

Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program for early January 2025. The Village's refuse hauling contractor will collect Christmas trees from residential properties with five or fewer units during the weeks of January 5 and January 12. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection areas by their normal pickup day during these two weeks.

The collected trees will be mulched at a licensed composting facility and used for soil enrichment, so residents should not place them in plastic bags or they won't be collected. Trees placed out after the program ends will require a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker, available at local stores and Village Hall. Wreaths and garlands cannot be recycled due to wire content and should go in regular trash.

Additionally, Oak Park residents can recycle holiday lights by dropping them off at the Public Works Center lobby at 201 South Blvd during business hours through January, or schedule e-waste pickup online. This program helps residents properly dispose of holiday decorations while supporting the Village's environmental sustainability efforts.

Oak Park has approved its 2026 municipal budget totaling $223 million in expenditures, with a $96 million general fund supporting day-to-day operations. The budget prioritizes core services through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments while advancing Village Board strategic goals including community affordability, racial equity, sustainability, and economic vitality. Property taxes will fund 36% of general fund expenditures, representing approximately 15.2% of a typical property owner's tax bill.

The budget includes modest increases in utility and service rates for residents. Refuse collection costs will rise slightly, with 96-gallon carts increasing from $30.22 to $31.13 monthly. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons (up from $11.37), while sewer rates rise to $3.42 per 1,000 gallons (up from $3.26). The majority of water and sewer fees cover the cost of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago and maintaining local water systems.

Budget documents and process information are available at www.oak-park.us/budget, allowing residents to review how their tax dollars support municipal services and strategic community initiatives throughout 2026.
