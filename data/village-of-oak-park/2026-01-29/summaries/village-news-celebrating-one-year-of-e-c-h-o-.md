## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is celebrating the first anniversary of its E.C.H.O. program (Engaging Communities for Healthy Outcomes), which launched in 2025 to connect residents with essential support services. The program has demonstrated significant impact in its inaugural year, completing more than 700 referrals by the end of 2025 and serving as a vital bridge between community members and needed resources.

E.C.H.O. provides comprehensive care coordination across a wide range of services, including wellness checks, housing assistance, extreme weather support, food and utility resources, domestic violence services, and behavioral health care. The program's success has been made possible through partnerships with the Oak Park Police and Fire Departments, local community organizations, and residents who have trusted the E.C.H.O. team to provide assistance.

As the program enters its second year in 2026, E.C.H.O. plans to expand its reach and strengthen community collaborations. Oak Park residents can access more information about the program at www.oak-park.us/echo or contact the team directly at 708.358.5640 or echo@oak-park.us. Each referral represents personalized, timely support for residents when they need it most, reinforcing the program's goal of building a more responsive and connected community.
