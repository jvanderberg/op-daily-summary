## Summary

Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program for early January 2025. The Village's refuse hauling contractor will collect Christmas trees from residential properties with five or fewer units during the weeks of January 5 and January 12. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection areas by their normal pickup day during these two weeks.

The collected trees will be mulched at a licensed composting facility and used for soil enrichment, so residents should not place them in plastic bags or they won't be collected. Trees placed out after the program ends will require a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker, available at local stores and Village Hall. Wreaths and garlands cannot be recycled due to wire content and should go in regular trash.

Additionally, Oak Park residents can recycle holiday lights by dropping them off at the Public Works Center lobby at 201 South Blvd during business hours through January, or schedule e-waste pickup online. This program helps residents properly dispose of holiday decorations while supporting the Village's environmental sustainability efforts.
