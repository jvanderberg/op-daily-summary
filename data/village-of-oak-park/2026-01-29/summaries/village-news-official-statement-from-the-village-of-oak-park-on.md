## Summary

The Village of Oak Park announced it will proceed with acquiring U.S. Bank's property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain using "quick-take" powers for a new police station. Following a public hearing on January 13, 2026, the Village confirmed that negotiations with U.S. Bank for a voluntary sale were unsuccessful, despite the Village's offers to help the bank find a new location within Oak Park. The bank had listed the property in February 2025 and indicated it could vacate as soon as 24 months after acquisition.

The Village's decision comes amid U.S. Bank's pattern of closing branches in Oak Park and the surrounding area. Since 2014, the bank has closed five locations in or near the Village, including branches on South Oak Park Avenue, Roosevelt Road, North Avenue, and most recently in 2025, locations on North Oak Park Avenue and in Chicago's neighboring Austin area. This trend aligns with U.S. Bank's broader strategy of closing 40 brick-and-mortar locations across 17 states in 2025.

Village officials emphasized that the police station project is critical for public safety and that 11 Madison Street is ideal for adaptive reuse. While the Village remains open to helping U.S. Bank find alternative locations within Oak Park, officials stated they will not allow banking concerns to compromise this essential public safety infrastructure project.
