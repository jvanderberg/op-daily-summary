## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts at www.oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications. The system allows users to customize their notification preferences, choosing between text, email, and voice messages, as well as selecting specific types of alerts they want to receive and adding addresses for geographically targeted notifications.

Residents who were previously enrolled in the old system will receive prompts to set up new accounts, while those who no longer wish to receive notifications can simply take no action. The Village uses the system sparingly for important alerts including severe weather warnings, snow emergency parking notifications, and mosquito spraying announcements. The Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract, resulting in savings for the Village's Public Health Department, which manages emergency preparedness for the community.
