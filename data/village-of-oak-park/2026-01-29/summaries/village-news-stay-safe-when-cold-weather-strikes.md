## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has issued cold weather safety guidance as dangerously cold temperatures strike the area. Officials are urging residents to limit outdoor time for themselves and pets, and to check on friends and neighbors who may need assistance. The Oak Park Public Library's three branches are serving as warming centers during regular operating hours, and additional warming center information is available through Cook County's Department of Emergency Management and Chicago's city resources.

The village has provided comprehensive safety recommendations including dressing in multiple loose layers, wearing proper headwear and mittens, avoiding overexertion like heavy snow shoveling, and staying hydrated with warm liquids while avoiding alcohol and caffeine. Officials also emphasize the importance of protecting pipes from freezing by maintaining home temperatures above 55 degrees, opening cabinet doors around pipes, and letting faucets trickle cold water.

Additional safety measures include never using stoves, ovens, or fuel-burning devices indoors for heating due to carbon monoxide risks, ensuring space heaters are used safely on hard surfaces away from flammable materials, and avoiding travel during extreme weather. For those who must drive, the village recommends keeping emergency supplies like blankets, flashlights, and snacks in vehicles, along with ensuring cell phones are charged and informing others of travel plans.
