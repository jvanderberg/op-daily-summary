## Summary

Oak Park has approved its 2026 municipal budget totaling $223 million in expenditures, with a $96 million general fund supporting day-to-day operations. The budget prioritizes core services through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments while advancing Village Board strategic goals including community affordability, racial equity, sustainability, and economic vitality. Property taxes will fund 36% of general fund expenditures, representing approximately 15.2% of a typical property owner's tax bill.

The budget includes modest increases in utility and service rates for residents. Refuse collection costs will rise slightly, with 96-gallon carts increasing from $30.22 to $31.13 monthly. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons (up from $11.37), while sewer rates rise to $3.42 per 1,000 gallons (up from $3.26). The majority of water and sewer fees cover the cost of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago and maintaining local water systems.
