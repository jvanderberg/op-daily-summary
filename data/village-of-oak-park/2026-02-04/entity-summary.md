# Village of Oak Park - 2026-02-04

The Village of Oak Park is taking several steps to address public health needs this winter. During American Heart Month in February, the health department is encouraging residents to use the free indoor track at the Community Recreation Center and offering presentations on heart disease prevention. More immediately, free flu and COVID-19 rapid tests are available at Village Hall's Welcome Center during business hours as respiratory illnesses reach their highest levels nationally in over two decades.

Oak Park achieved significant recognition for environmental leadership, earning an 'A' score from the global nonprofit CDP - making it the only Illinois municipality to receive this distinction in 2025. The Village also released its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest rate increases for services like refuse collection and water. Meanwhile, winter tree pruning is underway in central Oak Park areas, with residents asked to move vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted.

The Village is moving forward with acquiring the U.S. Bank property at 11 Madison Street for a new police station through eminent domain after unsuccessful negotiations. Officials cited the bank's pattern of closing five Oak Park branches since 2014 as evidence of their withdrawal from the community. Residents also need to register for the new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme, as the Village has switched to an Everbridge platform that requires new accounts for continued notifications.

The Oak Park Public Health Department is promoting heart health awareness during American Heart Month in February 2026. The department emphasizes that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States but highlights actionable steps residents can take to reduce their risk.

Key recommendations include maintaining regular physical activity such as walking (Oak Park residents can use the free indoor track at the Community Recreation Center at 229 Madison St.), trying new heart-healthy recipes, quitting smoking, prioritizing seven hours of sleep nightly, and keeping up with annual medical and dental checkups. The department notes that untreated conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes can damage heart health, and even infections like gum disease can lead to heart problems.

Oak Park residents can request presentations about heart disease prevention by contacting the Public Health Department at 708.358.5480 or health@oak-park.us. The initiative provides local resources and practical tips to help community members improve their cardiovascular health during the winter months and beyond.

The Oak Park Public Health Department is offering free flu/COVID-19 combination rapid tests to residents at Village Hall in response to a significant increase in respiratory illnesses. Hospital admissions for influenza-like illnesses have reached their highest levels nationally in over two decades this season, prompting the local health response.

Residents experiencing flu-like symptoms such as fever, dry cough, trouble breathing, fatigue, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, or headaches are encouraged to get tested. Free tests are available at Village Hall's Welcome Center, located at 123 Madison St., during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays) while supplies last.

This initiative provides Oak Park residents with convenient access to respiratory illness testing during a time of heightened concern about flu and COVID-19 transmission. Community members are advised to contact the Health Department at 708.358.5480 or health@oak-park.us to confirm test availability before visiting Village Hall.

### Official Statement from the Village of Oak Park on U.S. Bank

- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Official-Statement-from-the-Village-of-Oak-Park-on-U.S.-Bank

The Village of Oak Park held a public hearing on January 13, 2026, regarding its plan to acquire U.S. Bank's property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain using "quick-take" powers. The Village selected this location in November 2025 for a new police station after U.S. Bank listed the property for sale in February 2025. Despite the Village's attempts to negotiate a voluntary sale and offers to help the bank find a new location within Oak Park, negotiations were unsuccessful, with the bank indicating it could leave the property within 24 months of acquisition.

The Village's statement emphasizes U.S. Bank's pattern of closing branches in Oak Park, citing five closures since 2014, particularly on the east side near Chicago's Austin neighborhood. These closures include locations on South Oak Park Avenue (2014), Roosevelt Road (2019), North Avenue (2021), and two in 2025 on Oak Park Avenue and in Chicago's Austin area. The Village argues this demonstrates the bank's ongoing withdrawal from the community.

Oak Park officials stress that the new police station is a critical investment for public safety and that 11 Madison Street is ideal for adaptive reuse. While the Village remains willing to help U.S. Bank find alternative locations within Oak Park, it states it will not allow the bank to impede this essential public safety project.

### Oak Park achieves CDP ‘A’ score for environmental leadership

Oak Park has achieved a prestigious 'A' score from CDP, a global environmental non-profit organization, placing it on CDP's annual 'A' List for environmental leadership. This recognition comes through CDP's independent environmental disclosure system, which tracks data from over 1,000 cities, states and regions worldwide. Oak Park is notably the only municipality in Illinois to receive this distinction in 2025.

To earn the 'A' score, Oak Park met rigorous leadership criteria including publicly disclosing environmental data, maintaining comprehensive city-wide emissions inventory, publishing a credible climate action plan, and completing climate risk assessments. The achievement reflects the community's work on "Climate Ready Oak Park," their comprehensive sustainability and resilience plan. Chief Sustainability Officer Lindsey Roland Nieratka emphasized that this recognition demonstrates the entire community's commitment to building a sustainable future and will energize continued climate initiatives to protect the environment and enhance resident well-being.

### Residents urged to sign up for emergency alerts on new platform

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts at www.oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications. The registration process allows users to customize their notification preferences, choosing between text, email, and voice messages, as well as selecting specific types of alerts they want to receive and adding addresses for geographically targeted notifications.

The Village uses the alert system sparingly for important situations such as severe weather warnings, snow emergency parking notifications, and mosquito spraying alerts. Residents who were previously enrolled in the old system will receive a message prompting them to set up a new account, while those who no longer wish to receive notifications don't need to take any action. The new Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract, resulting in savings for the Village's Public Health Department, which manages emergency preparedness.

### Make way for winter tree pruning
- **Type:** news
- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Make-way-for-winter-tree-pruning

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program for 2026, targeting a portion of the community's 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle pruning in the central section of Oak Park, specifically between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. The Village's own Forestry Division will focus on younger trees in the northern areas, covering zones between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

Residents are being asked to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to ensure crews can work quickly and safely. The pruning follows industry best practices to address tree health, resident safety, and property protection by removing dead limbs, raising canopies for traffic clearance, and creating appropriate spacing around structures. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually. This systematic approach has proven effective in minimizing storm damage and reducing ongoing pruning requests throughout the community.

### Holiday tree collection set for early January
- **Type:** news
- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Holiday-tree-collection-set-for-early-January

The Village of Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program for early January. Trees will be collected during the weeks of January 5 and January 12 from residential properties with five or fewer units that are served by the Village's refuse hauling contractor. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection area prior to their normal pickup day.

The program requires specific guidelines for proper collection: trees must be placed in the regular collection spot (in alleys if that's the normal pickup location), cannot be in plastic bags, and will be mulched at a licensed composting facility for soil enrichment. After the two-week collection period ends, residents will need to purchase a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker to dispose of trees. Wreaths and garlands cannot be recycled due to wire content and should go in regular trash.

Additionally, Oak Park residents can recycle holiday lights through the end of January by dropping them off at the Public Works Center lobby (201 South Blvd.) during business hours, or by scheduling e-waste pickup online. This program supports the village's environmental sustainability efforts while providing convenient disposal options for residents.

### 2026 budget centers on service delivery, strategic priorities

Oak Park has released its 2026 municipal budget, totaling $223 million in expenditures with a focus on delivering core services while advancing the Village Board's strategic priorities. The budget's $96 million general fund primarily supports day-to-day operations through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments, with projects designed to further goals in areas including community affordability, racial equity, sustainability, and economic vitality. Property taxes will fund 36% of the General Fund expenditures, representing approximately 15.2% of residents' total property tax bills.

The budget includes modest rate increases for various municipal services. Refuse collection costs will rise slightly, with 96-gallon carts increasing to $31.13 and 64-gallon carts to $28.27 monthly. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons (up from $11.37), while sewer rates will rise to $3.42 per 1,000 gallons of water used. The majority of water and sewer fees cover the cost of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago, with additional funds supporting local infrastructure maintenance and improvements.
