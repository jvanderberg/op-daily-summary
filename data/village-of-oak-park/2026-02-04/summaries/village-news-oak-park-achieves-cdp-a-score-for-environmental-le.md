## Summary

Oak Park has achieved a prestigious 'A' score from CDP, a global environmental non-profit organization, placing it on CDP's annual 'A' List for environmental leadership. This recognition comes through CDP's independent environmental disclosure system, which tracks data from over 1,000 cities, states and regions worldwide. Oak Park is notably the only municipality in Illinois to receive this distinction in 2025.

To earn the 'A' score, Oak Park met rigorous leadership criteria including publicly disclosing environmental data, maintaining comprehensive city-wide emissions inventory, publishing a credible climate action plan, and completing climate risk assessments. The achievement reflects the community's work on "Climate Ready Oak Park," their comprehensive sustainability and resilience plan. Chief Sustainability Officer Lindsey Roland Nieratka emphasized that this recognition demonstrates the entire community's commitment to building a sustainable future and will energize continued climate initiatives to protect the environment and enhance resident well-being.
