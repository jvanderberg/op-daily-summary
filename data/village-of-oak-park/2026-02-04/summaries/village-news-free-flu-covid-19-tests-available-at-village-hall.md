## Summary

The Oak Park Public Health Department is offering free flu/COVID-19 combination rapid tests to residents at Village Hall in response to a significant increase in respiratory illnesses. Hospital admissions for influenza-like illnesses have reached their highest levels nationally in over two decades this season, prompting the local health response.

Residents experiencing flu-like symptoms such as fever, dry cough, trouble breathing, fatigue, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, or headaches are encouraged to get tested. Free tests are available at Village Hall's Welcome Center, located at 123 Madison St., during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays) while supplies last.

This initiative provides Oak Park residents with convenient access to respiratory illness testing during a time of heightened concern about flu and COVID-19 transmission. Community members are advised to contact the Health Department at 708.358.5480 or health@oak-park.us to confirm test availability before visiting Village Hall.
