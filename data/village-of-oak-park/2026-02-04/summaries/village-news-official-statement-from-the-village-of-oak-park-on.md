## Summary

The Village of Oak Park held a public hearing on January 13, 2026, regarding its plan to acquire U.S. Bank's property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain using "quick-take" powers. The Village selected this location in November 2025 for a new police station after U.S. Bank listed the property for sale in February 2025. Despite the Village's attempts to negotiate a voluntary sale and offers to help the bank find a new location within Oak Park, negotiations were unsuccessful, with the bank indicating it could leave the property within 24 months of acquisition.

The Village's statement emphasizes U.S. Bank's pattern of closing branches in Oak Park, citing five closures since 2014, particularly on the east side near Chicago's Austin neighborhood. These closures include locations on South Oak Park Avenue (2014), Roosevelt Road (2019), North Avenue (2021), and two in 2025 on Oak Park Avenue and in Chicago's Austin area. The Village argues this demonstrates the bank's ongoing withdrawal from the community.

Oak Park officials stress that the new police station is a critical investment for public safety and that 11 Madison Street is ideal for adaptive reuse. While the Village remains willing to help U.S. Bank find alternative locations within Oak Park, it states it will not allow the bank to impede this essential public safety project.
