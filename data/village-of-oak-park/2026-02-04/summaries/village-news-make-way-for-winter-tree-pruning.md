## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program for 2026, targeting a portion of the community's 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle pruning in the central section of Oak Park, specifically between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. The Village's own Forestry Division will focus on younger trees in the northern areas, covering zones between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

Residents are being asked to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to ensure crews can work quickly and safely. The pruning follows industry best practices to address tree health, resident safety, and property protection by removing dead limbs, raising canopies for traffic clearance, and creating appropriate spacing around structures. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually. This systematic approach has proven effective in minimizing storm damage and reducing ongoing pruning requests throughout the community.
