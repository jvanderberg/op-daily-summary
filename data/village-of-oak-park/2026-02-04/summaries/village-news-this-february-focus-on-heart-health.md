## Summary

The Oak Park Public Health Department is promoting heart health awareness during American Heart Month in February 2026. The department emphasizes that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States but highlights actionable steps residents can take to reduce their risk.

Key recommendations include maintaining regular physical activity such as walking (Oak Park residents can use the free indoor track at the Community Recreation Center at 229 Madison St.), trying new heart-healthy recipes, quitting smoking, prioritizing seven hours of sleep nightly, and keeping up with annual medical and dental checkups. The department notes that untreated conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes can damage heart health, and even infections like gum disease can lead to heart problems.

Oak Park residents can request presentations about heart disease prevention by contacting the Public Health Department at 708.358.5480 or health@oak-park.us. The initiative provides local resources and practical tips to help community members improve their cardiovascular health during the winter months and beyond.
