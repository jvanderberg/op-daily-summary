## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts at www.oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications. The registration process allows users to customize their notification preferences, choosing between text, email, and voice messages, as well as selecting specific types of alerts they want to receive and adding addresses for geographically targeted notifications.

The Village uses the alert system sparingly for important situations such as severe weather warnings, snow emergency parking notifications, and mosquito spraying alerts. Residents who were previously enrolled in the old system will receive a message prompting them to set up a new account, while those who no longer wish to receive notifications don't need to take any action. The new Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract, resulting in savings for the Village's Public Health Department, which manages emergency preparedness.
