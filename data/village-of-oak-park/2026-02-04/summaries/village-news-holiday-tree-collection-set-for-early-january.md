## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program for early January. Trees will be collected during the weeks of January 5 and January 12 from residential properties with five or fewer units that are served by the Village's refuse hauling contractor. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection area prior to their normal pickup day.

The program requires specific guidelines for proper collection: trees must be placed in the regular collection spot (in alleys if that's the normal pickup location), cannot be in plastic bags, and will be mulched at a licensed composting facility for soil enrichment. After the two-week collection period ends, residents will need to purchase a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker to dispose of trees. Wreaths and garlands cannot be recycled due to wire content and should go in regular trash.

Additionally, Oak Park residents can recycle holiday lights through the end of January by dropping them off at the Public Works Center lobby (201 South Blvd.) during business hours, or by scheduling e-waste pickup online. This program supports the village's environmental sustainability efforts while providing convenient disposal options for residents.
