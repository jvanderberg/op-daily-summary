## Summary

Oak Park has released its 2026 municipal budget, totaling $223 million in expenditures with a focus on delivering core services while advancing the Village Board's strategic priorities. The budget's $96 million general fund primarily supports day-to-day operations through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments, with projects designed to further goals in areas including community affordability, racial equity, sustainability, and economic vitality. Property taxes will fund 36% of the General Fund expenditures, representing approximately 15.2% of residents' total property tax bills.

The budget includes modest rate increases for various municipal services. Refuse collection costs will rise slightly, with 96-gallon carts increasing to $31.13 and 64-gallon carts to $28.27 monthly. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons (up from $11.37), while sewer rates will rise to $3.42 per 1,000 gallons of water used. The majority of water and sewer fees cover the cost of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago, with additional funds supporting local infrastructure maintenance and improvements.
