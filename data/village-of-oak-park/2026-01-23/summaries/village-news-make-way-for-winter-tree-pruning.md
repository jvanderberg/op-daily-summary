## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program for a portion of its 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle pruning in the central section of Oak Park, including areas between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. The Village's Forestry Division will focus on younger trees in the north section, covering areas between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

The pruning follows industry best practices to address tree health, resident safety, and property protection by removing dead or dying limbs, raising tree canopies for safe traffic flow, and creating proper clearances around structures. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually. Residents are urged to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to ensure crews can work safely and efficiently.

This systematic approach has proven successful in minimizing storm damage and reducing ongoing pruning requests throughout Oak Park. Residents with questions or concerns about the pruning work can contact Public Works at 708.358.5700 or publicworks@oak-park.us, and additional information about the city's tree care program is available at www.oak-park.us/trees.
