## Summary

Oak Park has issued a cold weather safety advisory as dangerously cold temperatures with below-zero wind chills are forecast for the next several days. The village has activated emergency warming centers to help residents stay safe during the extreme weather conditions.

Two warming centers will be operating during this cold snap: Good Shepherd Lutheran Church (611 Randolph St.) will serve as a warming center from 7 p.m. Wednesday, January 21 until noon Saturday, January 24. After that, the Bridge Center at St. Catherine/St. Lucy (38 N. Austin Blvd.) will take over operations from Saturday afternoon until 8 a.m. Monday, January 26. Residents needing transportation to these centers can call the Oak Park Police Department's non-emergency number at 708.386.3800. The three Oak Park Public Library branches will also serve as warming centers during their regular hours.

This weather advisory significantly impacts Oak Park residents by providing critical resources during dangerous cold conditions while emphasizing community safety. Officials are urging residents to limit outdoor time for themselves and pets, check on elderly neighbors and friends, and take proper precautions such as layering clothing and protecting pipes from freezing. Village Hall will maintain normal Friday operations, and many municipal services remain available online to reduce the need for residents to venture out during the extreme weather.
