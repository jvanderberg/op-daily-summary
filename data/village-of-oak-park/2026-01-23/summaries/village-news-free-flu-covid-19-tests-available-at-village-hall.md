## Summary

The Oak Park Public Health Department is now offering free flu and COVID-19 combination rapid tests to residents at Village Hall in response to a significant surge in respiratory illnesses. Hospital admissions for influenza-like illnesses have reached their highest levels nationally in over two decades, prompting local health officials to take proactive measures to help residents identify infections early.

Residents experiencing flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulties, fatigue, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, or headaches are encouraged to get tested. Free tests are available at the Village Hall Welcome Center (123 Madison St.) during regular business hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, while supplies last. Community members can contact the Health Department at 708.358.5480 or health@oak-park.us to confirm test availability before visiting.

This initiative provides Oak Park residents with convenient, no-cost access to important health screening tools during a particularly challenging flu season, helping to protect both individual and community health through early detection of respiratory illnesses.
