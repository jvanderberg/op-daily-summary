## Summary

Oak Park has announced its 2026 municipal budget, totaling $223 million in expenditures with a $96 million general fund supporting daily operations. The budget prioritizes core services through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments while advancing the Village Board's strategic goals including community affordability, racial equity, sustainability, and economic vitality. Property taxes will fund 36% of the general fund, representing approximately 15.2% of a typical property owner's tax bill.

The budget includes modest increases in utility and service rates for residents. Refuse collection will see small increases, with 96-gallon carts rising to $31.13 monthly and compost collection increasing to $16.80. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons, while sewer rates will be $3.42 per 1,000 gallons. These increases primarily reflect the rising cost of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago and funding improvements to local water infrastructure.

The budget process information and complete budget documents are available on the Village's website at oak-park.us/budget, allowing residents to review how their tax dollars will be allocated across municipal services and strategic initiatives in the coming year.
