## Summary

The Village of Oak Park held a public hearing on January 13, 2026, regarding its decision to acquire the U.S. Bank property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain using "quick-take" powers. The property, which was selected in November 2025 as the site for a new police station, has been listed for sale by U.S. Bank since February 2025. Despite the Village's efforts to negotiate a voluntary sale and offer assistance in finding a suitable new branch location within Oak Park, negotiations were unsuccessful.

The Village's statement highlights U.S. Bank's pattern of closing branches in Oak Park, noting that the bank has shut down five locations since 2014, including branches on South Oak Park Avenue, Roosevelt Road, North Avenue, and most recently in 2025, locations on North Oak Park Avenue and in the adjacent Austin neighborhood in Chicago. According to federal banking data, U.S. Bank confirmed plans to close 40 brick-and-mortar locations across 17 states in 2025, with the closures particularly concentrated on Oak Park's east side near Chicago's Austin neighborhood.

Village officials emphasized that the police station project is critical for protecting residents' health, safety, and welfare, and that 11 Madison Street represents an ideal location for adaptive reuse. While the Village remains open to helping U.S. Bank find a new location within Oak Park, officials stated they will not allow the bank to impede this important public safety project.
