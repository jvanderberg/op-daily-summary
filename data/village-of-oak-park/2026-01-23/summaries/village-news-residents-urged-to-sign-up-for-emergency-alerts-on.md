## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts at www.oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications. The system allows users to customize how they receive alerts (text, email, or voice message) and what types of notifications they want, including severe weather warnings, snow emergency parking alerts, and mosquito spraying notices. Users can also add addresses to receive location-specific alerts.

Residents who were enrolled in the previous notification system will receive a message prompting them to create a new account, while those who no longer wish to receive alerts don't need to take any action. The new Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract with the company, saving money for the Village's Public Health Department, which manages emergency preparedness. The system represents an upgrade to a widely-used real-time emergency alert platform that serves municipalities throughout Cook County.
