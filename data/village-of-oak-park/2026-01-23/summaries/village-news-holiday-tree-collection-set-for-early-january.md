## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program, scheduled for the weeks of January 5 and January 12, 2025. The program serves residential properties of five or fewer units that are covered by the Village's refuse hauling contractor. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection areas ahead of their normal pickup day during these two weeks.

The collected trees will be mulched at a licensed composting facility for soil enrichment, so residents are instructed not to bag them in plastic. Trees placed out after the program ends will require a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker, available at local stores and Village Hall. Additionally, Oak Park residents can recycle holiday lights by dropping them off at the Public Works Center through January, while wreaths and garlands containing wire must go in regular trash containers.

This program supports Oak Park's sustainability efforts by diverting organic waste from landfills and converting it into useful compost material, providing residents with an environmentally responsible way to dispose of their holiday decorations.
