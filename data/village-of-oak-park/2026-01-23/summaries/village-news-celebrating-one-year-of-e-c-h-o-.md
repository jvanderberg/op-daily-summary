## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is celebrating the successful first year of its E.C.H.O. program (Engaging Communities for Healthy Outcomes) as 2025 comes to a close. The community support initiative has made a significant impact by completing more than 700 referrals in its inaugural year, connecting residents with a wide range of essential services including wellness checks, housing assistance, emergency weather support, food and utility resources, and behavioral health care.

E.C.H.O. operates as a care coordination bridge between Oak Park residents and needed support services, working in partnership with the Oak Park Police and Fire Departments along with various community-based organizations. The program provides person-centered assistance for various situations including fall support, domestic violence services, truancy support, and activation of warming and cooling centers during extreme weather events.

Looking forward to 2026, the Village plans to expand E.C.H.O.'s reach and strengthen community collaborations. Oak Park residents can access the program by visiting www.oak-park.us/echo, calling 708.358.5640, or emailing echo@oak-park.us. The program's success demonstrates Oak Park's commitment to building a more responsive and supportive community for all residents.
