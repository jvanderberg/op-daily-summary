# Village of Oak Park - 2026-01-23

Oak Park is dealing with dangerous cold temperatures this week, with warming centers activated at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church through Saturday and then at the Bridge Center at St. Catherine/St. Lucy through Monday morning. All three Oak Park Public Library branches will also serve as warming centers during regular hours, and residents needing transportation to these centers can call the police non-emergency number at 708.386.3800.

The Village has also announced that free flu and COVID-19 combination tests are now available at Village Hall's Welcome Center during weekday business hours. This comes as hospital admissions for flu-like illnesses have reached their highest levels nationally in over two decades. Residents experiencing symptoms like fever, cough, breathing difficulties, fatigue, or sore throat can get tested while supplies last - call 708.358.5480 to confirm availability before visiting.

In other news, Oak Park earned an 'A' rating from CDP for environmental leadership, becoming the only Illinois municipality to receive this recognition among more than 1,000 cities that reported environmental data in 2025. The Village is also transitioning to a new emergency alert system through Everbridge - all residents need to register at oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications about severe weather, snow emergencies, and other important alerts.

Oak Park has issued a cold weather safety advisory as dangerously cold temperatures with below-zero wind chills are forecast for the next several days. The village has activated emergency warming centers to help residents stay safe during the extreme weather conditions.

Two warming centers will be operating during this cold snap: Good Shepherd Lutheran Church (611 Randolph St.) will serve as a warming center from 7 p.m. Wednesday, January 21 until noon Saturday, January 24. After that, the Bridge Center at St. Catherine/St. Lucy (38 N. Austin Blvd.) will take over operations from Saturday afternoon until 8 a.m. Monday, January 26.

This weather advisory significantly impacts Oak Park residents by providing critical resources during dangerous cold conditions while emphasizing community safety. Officials are urging residents to limit outdoor time for themselves and pets, check on elderly neighbors and friends, and take proper precautions such as layering clothing and protecting pipes from freezing. Village Hall will maintain normal Friday operations, and many municipal services remain available online to reduce the need for residents to venture out during the extreme weather.

### Official Statement from the Village of Oak Park on U.S. Bank

The Village of Oak Park held a public hearing on January 13, 2026, regarding its decision to acquire the U.S. Bank property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain using "quick-take" powers. The property, which was selected in November 2025 as the site for a new police station, has been listed for sale by U.S. Bank since February 2025. Despite the Village's efforts to negotiate a voluntary sale and offer assistance in finding a suitable new branch location within Oak Park, negotiations were unsuccessful.

The Village's statement highlights U.S. Bank's pattern of closing branches in Oak Park, noting that the bank has shut down five locations since 2014, including branches on South Oak Park Avenue, Roosevelt Road, North Avenue, and most recently in 2025, locations on North Oak Park Avenue and in the adjacent Austin neighborhood in Chicago. According to federal banking data, U.S. Bank confirmed plans to close 40 brick-and-mortar locations across 17 states in 2025, with the closures particularly concentrated on Oak Park's east side near Chicago's Austin neighborhood.

Village officials emphasized that the police station project is critical for protecting residents' health, safety, and welfare, and that 11 Madison Street represents an ideal location for adaptive reuse. While the Village remains open to helping U.S. Bank find a new location within Oak Park, officials stated they will not allow the bank to impede this important public safety project.

Oak Park has achieved a prestigious 'A' score from CDP, a global environmental non-profit organization, earning a place on CDP's annual 'A' List for environmental leadership. This recognition, announced on January 15, 2026, places Oak Park among global leaders demonstrating comprehensive environmental disclosure, mature governance, and meaningful progress toward environmental resilience. The village is notably the only municipality in Illinois to receive this distinction among the more than 1,000 cities, states, and regions that reported environmental data through CDP in 2025.

To earn the 'A' rating, Oak Park met rigorous criteria including publicly disclosing environmental data, maintaining a comprehensive city-wide emissions inventory, publishing a credible climate action plan, and completing a full climate risk assessment. The score reflects the community's implementation of "Climate Ready Oak Park," the village's comprehensive sustainability and resilience plan. Chief Sustainability Officer Lindsey Roland Nieratka emphasized that this recognition reflects the entire community's commitment to building a sustainable future and will energize continued advancement of bold climate initiatives to protect the environment and enhance resident well-being.

### Residents urged to sign up for emergency alerts on new platform

- **URL:** https://www.oak-park.us/News-articles/Sign-up-for-emergency-alerts-on-new-platform

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts at www.oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications. The system allows users to customize how they receive alerts (text, email, or voice message) and what types of notifications they want, including severe weather warnings, snow emergency parking alerts, and mosquito spraying notices. Users can also add addresses to receive location-specific alerts.

Residents who were enrolled in the previous notification system will receive a message prompting them to create a new account, while those who no longer wish to receive alerts don't need to take any action. The new Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract with the company, saving money for the Village's Public Health Department, which manages emergency preparedness. The system represents an upgrade to a widely-used real-time emergency alert platform that serves municipalities throughout Cook County.

### Make way for winter tree pruning

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program for a portion of its 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle pruning in the central section of Oak Park, including areas between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. The Village's Forestry Division will focus on younger trees in the north section, covering areas between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

The pruning follows industry best practices to address tree health, resident safety, and property protection by removing dead or dying limbs, raising tree canopies for safe traffic flow, and creating proper clearances around structures. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually. Residents are urged to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to ensure crews can work safely and efficiently.

This systematic approach has proven successful in minimizing storm damage and reducing ongoing pruning requests throughout Oak Park. Residents with questions or concerns about the pruning work can contact Public Works at 708.358.5700 or publicworks@oak-park.us, and additional information about the city's tree care program is available at www.oak-park.us/trees.

### Holiday tree collection set for early January

The Village of Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program, scheduled for the weeks of January 5 and January 12, 2025. The program serves residential properties of five or fewer units that are covered by the Village's refuse hauling contractor. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection areas ahead of their normal pickup day during these two weeks.

The collected trees will be mulched at a licensed composting facility for soil enrichment, so residents are instructed not to bag them in plastic. Trees placed out after the program ends will require a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker, available at local stores and Village Hall. Additionally, Oak Park residents can recycle holiday lights by dropping them off at the Public Works Center through January, while wreaths and garlands containing wire must go in regular trash containers.

This program supports Oak Park's sustainability efforts by diverting organic waste from landfills and converting it into useful compost material, providing residents with an environmentally responsible way to dispose of their holiday decorations.

### 2026 budget centers on service delivery, strategic priorities

Oak Park has announced its 2026 municipal budget, totaling $223 million in expenditures with a $96 million general fund supporting daily operations. The budget prioritizes core services through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments while advancing the Village Board's strategic goals including community affordability, racial equity, sustainability, and economic vitality. Property taxes will fund 36% of the general fund, representing approximately 15.2% of a typical property owner's tax bill.

The budget includes modest increases in utility and service rates for residents. Refuse collection will see small increases, with 96-gallon carts rising to $31.13 monthly and compost collection increasing to $16.80. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons, while sewer rates will be $3.42 per 1,000 gallons. These increases primarily reflect the rising cost of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago and funding improvements to local water infrastructure.

The budget process information and complete budget documents are available on the Village's website at oak-park.us/budget, allowing residents to review how their tax dollars will be allocated across municipal services and strategic initiatives in the coming year.
