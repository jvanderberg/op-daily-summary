# Village of Oak Park - 2026-01-19

The Oak Park Village Board held its regular meeting on January 20, focusing on several key initiatives. The board reviewed new Energy Grant Guidelines for 2026 and discussed other energy efficiency programming during their study session. They also considered an intergovernmental agreement with the University of Illinois for emergency fire communications training through a grant-funded program with the Illinois Fire Science Institute.

Administrative business included approving the October 2025 treasurer's report and finalizing the Village Board Protocols that will govern operations through 2028. The board also issued a proclamation recognizing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in Oak Park.

At their January 13 meeting, the board tackled several major contracts including a $212,000 water meter purchase agreement and a five-year, $179,489 annual contract for government software services. They also held a public hearing on eminent domain proceedings for properties at 3-31 Madison Street and 509 S. Humphrey Avenue, and reviewed findings from a village waste characterization study as they evaluate future waste hauling options.
