## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program, which will target a portion of the community's 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle most of the pruning in the central section of Oak Park, covering areas between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. Additionally, the Village's Forestry Division will prune younger trees in the north section, specifically between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

The pruning follows industry best practices and focuses on three main objectives: maintaining tree health, ensuring resident safety, and protecting property from damage. Crews will remove dead or dying limbs, raise tree canopies for safe vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and create appropriate clearances around structures and signs. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually.

Residents are encouraged to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to allow crews to work safely and efficiently. The Village asks residents to contact 708.358.5700 or email publicworks@oak-park.us with any questions or concerns about the pruning work being performed by contractors.
