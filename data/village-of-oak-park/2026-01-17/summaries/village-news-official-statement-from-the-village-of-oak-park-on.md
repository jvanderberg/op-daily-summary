## Summary

The Village of Oak Park held a public hearing on January 13, 2026, regarding its plan to acquire a U.S. Bank property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain for a new police station. The Village had attempted to negotiate a voluntary sale with the bank after it listed the property in February 2025, but was unable to reach agreeable terms. U.S. Bank had indicated it would be willing to leave the location within 24 months of acquisition, if not sooner.

The Village's decision comes amid a pattern of U.S. Bank branch closures in Oak Park and surrounding areas. Since 2014, the bank has closed five locations in and around the village, including four within Oak Park itself and one in Chicago's adjacent Austin neighborhood. U.S. Bank confirmed in 2025 that it would close 40 brick-and-mortar locations across 17 states, including Illinois, as part of a broader pullback from the area.

Oak Park officials emphasized that the police station project is critical for public safety and that the Madison Street location is ideal for the adaptive reuse project. While the Village stated it remains willing to help U.S. Bank find a suitable new location within Oak Park, it will proceed with the eminent domain acquisition to ensure the police station project moves forward as planned.
