## Summary

Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program, scheduled for the weeks of January 5 and January 12, 2025. The service is available to residential properties with five or fewer units that are served by the Village's refuse hauling contractor. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection areas, and trees should not be placed in plastic bags since they will be mulched at a licensed composting facility for soil enrichment.

The Village has also set up a holiday light recycling program through the end of January. Residents can drop off lights in a bin at the Public Works Center lobby at 201 South Blvd during regular business hours, or schedule e-waste pickup online. However, wreaths and garlands cannot be recycled due to wire components and should be placed in regular trash containers.

After the collection period ends, any trees left for pickup will require a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker, available at local stores and Village Hall. This program helps Oak Park residents dispose of holiday decorations in an environmentally responsible way while supporting the community's sustainability efforts.
