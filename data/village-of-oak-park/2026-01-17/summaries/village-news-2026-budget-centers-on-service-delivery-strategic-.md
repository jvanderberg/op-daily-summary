## Summary

The Village of Oak Park has adopted its 2026 municipal budget, totaling $223 million in expenditures with a $96 million general fund supporting daily operations. The budget prioritizes core services through the Police, Fire, and Public Works departments while advancing Village Board strategic goals including community affordability, health and safety, racial equity, neighborhood connectivity, sustainability, economic vitality, and organizational effectiveness. Property taxes will fund 36% of the General Fund, representing approximately 15.2% of residents' total property tax bills.

The 2026 budget includes modest increases in utility and service rates for Oak Park residents. Refuse collection costs will rise slightly, with 96-gallon carts increasing to $31.13 monthly and 64-gallon carts to $28.27. Water rates will increase to $11.94 per 1,000 gallons, while sewer rates will be $3.42 per 1,000 gallons. These rate increases primarily reflect the rising costs of purchasing Lake Michigan water from Chicago and maintaining local water infrastructure.
