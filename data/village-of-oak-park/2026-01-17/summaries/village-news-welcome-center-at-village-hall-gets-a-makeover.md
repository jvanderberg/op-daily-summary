## Summary

Oak Park's Village Hall has unveiled a redesigned Welcome Center that creates a more inclusive and accessible space for residents visiting the municipal government headquarters at 123 Madison Street. The renovation removed COVID-19 era safety partitions and replaced them with an open, free-flowing layout featuring a centrally located help desk where visitors can access various local government services and information.

The changes are part of the Village's broader effort to restore transparency and accessibility to municipal government, returning to the building's original open interior design concept. The Welcome Center renovation is connected to the Neighborhood Partnerships Division's mission to enhance community and civic engagement through neighborhood-focused initiatives.

The redesigned space is open for in-person services Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., providing Oak Park residents with improved access to local government resources and assistance in a more welcoming environment.
