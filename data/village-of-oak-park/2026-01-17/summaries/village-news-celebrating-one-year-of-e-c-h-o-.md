## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is celebrating the first anniversary of its E.C.H.O. program (Engaging Communities for Healthy Outcomes) as 2025 comes to a close. The community care coordination initiative has demonstrated significant impact in its inaugural year, completing over 700 referrals that connected residents with essential services ranging from wellness checks and housing assistance to domestic violence support and behavioral health care.

E.C.H.O. has served as a crucial bridge between Oak Park residents and needed support services, working in partnership with the Oak Park Police and Fire Departments, local community organizations, and residents themselves. The program's success reflects its person-centered approach to providing timely assistance when residents need it most, covering areas such as extreme weather support, food and utility resources, truancy assistance, and falls support.

Looking toward 2026, the Village plans to expand E.C.H.O.'s reach and strengthen community collaboration to continue building a responsive and supportive environment for all Oak Park residents. Residents can learn more about the program at www.oak-park.us/echo or contact the team directly at 708.358.5640.
