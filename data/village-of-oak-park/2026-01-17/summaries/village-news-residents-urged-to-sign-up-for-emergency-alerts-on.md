## Summary

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts to continue receiving emergency notifications. Residents can sign up at www.oak-park.us/notifyme and customize their preferences for how they want to be contacted (text, email, or voice message) and what types of alerts they wish to receive, including severe weather, snow emergency parking, and mosquito spraying notifications.

The new Everbridge platform is provided at no cost to Oak Park through Cook County's contract with the company, creating savings for the Village's Public Health Department. Residents who were previously enrolled in the old system will receive a message prompting them to create a new account, while those who no longer want alerts don't need to take any action. The system also offers geographically targeted alerts based on address information provided during registration.
