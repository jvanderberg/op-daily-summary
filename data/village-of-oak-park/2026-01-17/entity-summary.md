The Village of Oak Park held a public hearing on January 13, 2026, regarding its plan to acquire a U.S. Bank property at 11 Madison Street through eminent domain for a new police station. The Village had attempted to negotiate a voluntary sale with the bank after it listed the property in February 2025, but was unable to reach agreeable terms. U.S. Bank had indicated it would be willing to leave the location within 24 months of acquisition, if not sooner.

The Village's decision comes amid a pattern of U.S. Bank branch closures in Oak Park and surrounding areas. Since 2014, the bank has closed five locations in and around the village, including four within Oak Park itself and one in Chicago's adjacent Austin neighborhood. U.S. Bank confirmed in 2025 that it would close 40 brick-and-mortar locations across 17 states, including Illinois, as part of a broader pullback from the area.

Oak Park officials emphasized that the police station project is critical for public safety and that the Madison Street location is ideal for the adaptive reuse project. While the Village stated it remains willing to help U.S. Bank find a suitable new location within Oak Park, it will proceed with the eminent domain acquisition to ensure the police station project moves forward as planned.

Oak Park has earned a prestigious 'A' score from CDP, a global environmental non-profit organization, placing it on the annual 'A' List for environmental leadership.

The village also demonstrated additional leadership through securing formal political commitment to advance climate initiatives and deliver low-carbon development.

This recognition highlights Oak Park's commitment to environmental transparency and climate action, positioning the community among global leaders in sustainability. According to Chief Sustainability Officer Lindsey Roland Nieratka, the achievement energizes the village to continue advancing bold climate initiatives that protect the environment and enhance resident well-being.

The Village of Oak Park is transitioning to a new emergency alert system powered by Everbridge, requiring all residents to register for new accounts to continue receiving emergency notifications.

The Village of Oak Park has announced its winter tree pruning program, which will target a portion of the community's 18,000-plus parkway trees. A private contractor will handle most of the pruning in the central section of Oak Park, covering areas between South Boulevard and Madison Street, and between Madison Street and I-290 from Scoville Avenue to Austin Boulevard. Additionally, the Village's Forestry Division will prune younger trees in the north section, specifically between North Avenue and Division Street, and between Division Street and Chicago Avenue from Ridgeland Avenue to Austin Boulevard.

The pruning follows industry best practices and focuses on three main objectives: maintaining tree health, ensuring resident safety, and protecting property from damage. Crews will remove dead or dying limbs, raise tree canopies for safe vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and create appropriate clearances around structures and signs. The Village operates on a four-year pruning cycle for all public trees, accounting for the fact that parkway trees can grow up to two feet annually.

Residents are encouraged to move their vehicles when temporary no-parking signs are posted to allow crews to work safely and efficiently. The Village asks residents to contact 708.358.5700 or email publicworks@oak-park.us with any questions or concerns about the pruning work being performed by contractors.

Oak Park has announced its annual holiday tree collection program, scheduled for the weeks of January 5 and January 12, 2025. The service is available to residential properties with five or fewer units that are served by the Village's refuse hauling contractor. Residents must remove all decorations and stands before placing trees in their regular collection areas, and trees should not be placed in plastic bags since they will be mulched at a licensed composting facility for soil enrichment.

The Village has also set up a holiday light recycling program through the end of January. Residents can drop off lights in a bin at the Public Works Center lobby at 201 South Blvd during regular business hours, or schedule e-waste pickup online. However, wreaths and garlands cannot be recycled due to wire components and should be placed in regular trash containers.

After the collection period ends, any trees left for pickup will require a $4 pink bulk refuse sticker, available at local stores and Village Hall. This program helps Oak Park residents dispose of holiday decorations in an environmentally responsible way while supporting the community's sustainability efforts.

The Village of Oak Park has adopted its 2026 municipal budget, totaling $223 million in expenditures with a $96 million general fund supporting daily operations.

The 2026 budget includes modest increases in utility and service rates for Oak Park residents.
