**Oak Park Activates Warming Centers for Dangerous Cold Weather**

Oak Park officials have announced the opening of multiple warming centers as dangerously cold temperatures with below-zero wind chills are forecast for several days. Good Shepherd Lutheran Church (611 Randolph St.) will serve as a warming center from 6 p.m. Wednesday, January 21 through Saturday, January 24 at noon. Following that, St. Catherine/St. Lucy (38 N. Austin Blvd.) will operate as a 24-hour warming center from Saturday afternoon through Monday, January 26 at 8 a.m. The three Oak Park Public Library branches also serve as warming centers during regular hours, and residents needing transportation can call the Oak Park Police non-emergency line at 708.386.3800.

**Safety Measures and Community Impact**

The extreme weather poses significant risks to Oak Park residents, with officials warning that exposed skin can develop frostbite within minutes in very cold, windy conditions. The village has issued comprehensive safety guidelines including dressing in layers, limiting outdoor time for both people and pets, checking on elderly or isolated neighbors, and protecting pipes from freezing by keeping thermostats above 55 degrees. Officials strongly advise against using dangerous heating methods like stoves, ovens, or fuel-burning devices indoors, and recommend avoiding travel during the extreme weather conditions.
