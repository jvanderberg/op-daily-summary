**Safety Measures and Community Impact**

The extreme weather poses significant risks to Oak Park residents, with officials warning that exposed skin can develop frostbite within minutes in very cold, windy conditions. The village has issued comprehensive safety guidelines including dressing in layers, limiting outdoor time for both people and pets, checking on elderly or isolated neighbors, and protecting pipes from freezing by keeping thermostats above 55 degrees. Officials strongly advise against using dangerous heating methods like stoves, ovens, or fuel-burning devices indoors, and recommend avoiding travel during the extreme weather conditions.
