## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library is launching its "Six in 2026" initiative, encouraging residents to read just six minutes daily for health benefits. Health & Wellness Librarian Claire Ong announced the program, citing University of Sussex research showing that six minutes of reading can significantly reduce stress by lowering heart rate, easing muscle tension, and calming the nervous system. Additional studies indicate that regular reading helps slow cognitive decline and protects memory function in later years.

The library has scheduled numerous events throughout early 2026 to support New Year wellness goals and community connection. Health-focused offerings include virtual Chair Yoga sessions on Tuesdays and monthly Sound Bath Meditation at the Main Library. Community-building activities feature outdoor events with the Trailside Museum, including a Nature Walk & Mingle for Singles on February 14 and a Winter Tree ID Hike on February 20. The museum also provides snowshoes and ice traction covers for winter activities.

Virtual programming allows residents to participate from home, with events like "Inviting Nature Home to Your Backyard" on January 28, a cooking class on "Brownies, Blondies & Brookies" February 11, and a special author presentation with Pulitzer Prize winner Percival Everett on March 19. These diverse offerings aim to help Oak Park residents reset for the new year while staying engaged during the cold winter months.
