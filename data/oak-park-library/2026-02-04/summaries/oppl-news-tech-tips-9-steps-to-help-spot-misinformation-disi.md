This article by Oak Park's Civic Literacy Librarian Simon Czerwinskyj provides guidance on navigating today's complex media landscape and distinguishing between reliable and unreliable information sources. With another election cycle approaching, Czerwinskyj emphasizes the importance of developing strong media literacy skills to combat the spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms and news outlets.
