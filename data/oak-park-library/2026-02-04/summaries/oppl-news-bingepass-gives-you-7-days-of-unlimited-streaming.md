## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library has announced a new digital service called hoopla's BingePass, which provides library cardholders with unlimited streaming access to premium content for seven days with a single borrow. This service offers a wide variety of digital content across multiple categories including movies, TV shows, documentaries, magazines, comics, educational courses, fitness programs, games, and children's content from popular providers like Hallmark+, BBC, The Great Courses, and PBS Kids.

The BingePass system is organized into content for all ages, adults and teens, and kids specifically. Notable offerings include documentaries from Curiosity Stream, classic comics through Comics Kingdom, fitness programs from Get Healthy U TV, cooking shows with Julia Child, Korean dramas and anime through AsianCrush, and educational content like Ken Burns documentaries. For children, there are interactive learning activities, animated story readings, STEM-focused ebooks, and shows like Pokémon and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.

Oak Park residents can access BingePasses through the hoopla app on mobile devices or through a web browser, and after borrowing, they're logged directly into the partner platforms to explore content. When the seven-day borrowing period ends, users can borrow the same BingePass again, making this a valuable resource for continuous access to premium digital entertainment and educational content through their library card.
