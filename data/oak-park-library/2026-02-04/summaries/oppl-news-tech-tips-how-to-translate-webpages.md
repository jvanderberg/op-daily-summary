## Summary

**Oak Park Public Library Provides Multilingual Web Translation Guide**

The Oak Park Public Library has published a comprehensive guide on translating web pages in multiple languages, authored by John Gargiulo, Supervising Librarian of Creative Technology. The guide, which has been translated into Spanish and Polish by library staff, provides step-by-step instructions for using translation features in four major web browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

The detailed tutorial covers how to translate individual web pages, set preferred languages, and enable automatic translation features in each browser. For Chrome users, the guide explains accessing the three-dot menu and translation options, while Safari users learn to use the View menu's translation settings. Firefox and Edge users receive specific instructions for their respective browser interfaces, including how to customize language preferences and access translation pop-ups.

This multilingual resource demonstrates the Oak Park Public Library's commitment to serving its diverse community by making digital literacy accessible to Spanish and Polish speakers. The library encourages residents with technology questions to contact them directly and offers additional digital resources, including Tech Tips email subscriptions. The initiative reflects the library's broader mission to help patrons navigate and utilize technology effectively regardless of their primary language.
