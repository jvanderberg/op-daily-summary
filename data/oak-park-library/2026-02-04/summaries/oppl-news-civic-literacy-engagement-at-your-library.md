## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library has hired Simon Czerwinskyj as its first Civic Literacy Librarian in late 2025, marking a significant expansion of the library's commitment to supporting democratic participation. Czerwinskyj develops programming around current civic topics and provides essential information about elections, taxes, and local government functions, with the goal of empowering and engaging the Oak Park community in civic life.

The library is offering several upcoming programs to help residents prepare for the March 17 Gubernatorial Primary Election and engage with important civic issues. Key events include a tax bill explanation session with Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi on February 5, discussions about AI and data centers on February 21, a presentation on Project 2025's impact on democracy on March 5, and a virtual news media literacy workshop on March 31. The library has also created a comprehensive Civic Engagement resources hub covering voting, elected officials, news evaluation, and political participation.

These initiatives reflect the library's recognition of its crucial role in supporting democratic processes and providing Oak Park residents with the tools and information they need to be informed, engaged citizens in their community.
