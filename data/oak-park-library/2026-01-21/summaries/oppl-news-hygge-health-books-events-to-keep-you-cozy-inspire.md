## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library is launching its "Six in 2026" initiative to promote health and wellness through reading in the new year. Health & Wellness Specialist Claire Ong announced that reading for just six minutes daily can significantly benefit mental health by lowering stress, slowing heart rate, easing muscle tension, and potentially slowing cognitive decline. The library's Collection Management team has curated a special book list to help residents start their wellness journey.

The library is offering numerous programs throughout the winter to support community health and connection. Health-focused events include Chair Yoga on Tuesdays at 12:30 pm (virtual) and monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions at the Main Library. For those seeking outdoor activities, the library has partnered with Trailside Museum to offer nature walks and winter tree identification hikes in February, with snowshoes and ice traction covers available for loan.

Virtual programming allows residents to stay engaged from home, featuring events like "Inviting Nature Home to Your Backyard" (January 28), a cooking class on brownies and blondies (February 11), and a special presentation with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Percival Everett (March 19). These diverse offerings aim to help Oak Park residents maintain their New Year's resolutions while building community connections during the cold winter months.
