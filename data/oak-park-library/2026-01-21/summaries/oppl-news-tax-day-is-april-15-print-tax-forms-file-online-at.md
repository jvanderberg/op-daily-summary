## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library is providing resources and information to help residents prepare for the April 15 federal and state tax filing deadline. The library offers free printing of popular tax forms on public computers, though they maintain only limited preprinted copies of federal and state 1040 forms on the Main Library's third floor. Residents can print up to 50 pages at no charge using library computers or through remote printing for same-day pickup.

For those seeking filing assistance, several free options are available to qualifying residents. Taxpayers who earned $89,000 or less in 2025 can use IRS Free File software, while free tax preparation services are offered through organizations like Triton College, AARP Tax Aid, VITA sites, and Ladder Up's Tax Assistance Program for lower-income individuals and families. The library emphasizes that while they provide access to forms and computers, their staff cannot assist with completing tax forms.

This initiative helps Oak Park residents access essential tax resources and support services during tax season, particularly benefiting those who may not have home computer access or who qualify for free professional assistance based on their income levels.
