# Oak Park Public Library - 2026-01-21

The Oak Park Public Library is helping residents tackle tax season with free printing services and computer access for those filing by the April 15 deadline. You can print up to 50 pages of tax forms at no charge on library computers or through remote printing for same-day pickup. Limited hard copies of federal and state 1040 forms are available on the Main Library's third floor. For those needing help, the library has compiled information about free filing services available to qualifying residents, including IRS Free File (for those earning under $89,000) and assistance through organizations like AARP Tax Aid and Triton College.

Meanwhile, the library is launching its "Six in 2026" wellness initiative, encouraging residents to read just six minutes daily for mental health benefits like reduced stress and improved cognitive function. Health & Wellness Specialist Claire Ong is promoting this alongside winter programming that includes Chair Yoga (Tuesdays at 12:30 pm virtual), monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions, and nature walks with Trailside Museum in February. Snowshoes and ice traction covers are available for loan.

The library is also offering virtual programs to keep residents engaged from home, including a backyard nature presentation on January 28, a brownies and blondies cooking class February 11, and a special event with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Percival Everett on March 19.

The Oak Park Public Library is providing resources and information to help residents prepare for the April 15 federal and state tax filing deadline. The library offers free printing of popular tax forms on public computers, though they maintain only limited preprinted copies of federal and state 1040 forms on the Main Library's third floor. Residents can print up to 50 pages at no charge using library computers or through remote printing for same-day pickup.

For those seeking filing assistance, several free options are available to qualifying residents. Taxpayers who earned $89,000 or less in 2025 can use IRS Free File software, while free tax preparation services are offered through organizations like Triton College, AARP Tax Aid, VITA sites, and Ladder Up's Tax Assistance Program for lower-income individuals and families. The library emphasizes that while they provide access to forms and computers, their staff cannot assist with completing tax forms.

This initiative helps Oak Park residents access essential tax resources and support services during tax season, particularly benefiting those who may not have home computer access or who qualify for free professional assistance based on their income levels.

The Oak Park Public Library is launching its "Six in 2026" initiative to promote health and wellness through reading in the new year. Health & Wellness Specialist Claire Ong announced that reading for just six minutes daily can significantly benefit mental health by lowering stress, slowing heart rate, easing muscle tension, and potentially slowing cognitive decline. The library's Collection Management team has curated a special book list to help residents start their wellness journey.

The library is offering numerous programs throughout the winter to support community health and connection. Health-focused events include Chair Yoga on Tuesdays at 12:30 pm (virtual) and monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions at the Main Library. For those seeking outdoor activities, the library has partnered with Trailside Museum to offer nature walks and winter tree identification hikes in February, with snowshoes and ice traction covers available for loan.

Virtual programming allows residents to stay engaged from home, featuring events like "Inviting Nature Home to Your Backyard" (January 28), a cooking class on brownies and blondies (February 11), and a special presentation with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Percival Everett (March 19). These diverse offerings aim to help Oak Park residents maintain their New Year's resolutions while building community connections during the cold winter months.
