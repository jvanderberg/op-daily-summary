# Oak Park Public Library - 2026-01-17

The Oak Park Public Library kicked off 2026 with an ambitious "Six in 2026" health and wellness campaign encouraging residents to read just six minutes daily. Based on University of Sussex research showing that six minutes of reading can significantly reduce stress and slow cognitive decline, the library is offering extensive winter programming including virtual Chair Yoga sessions every Tuesday at 12:30 pm, monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions, and outdoor activities like nature walks and tree identification hikes partnered with Trailside Museum. The initiative also features virtual sessions on eco-friendly gardening, baking techniques, and an author talk with Pulitzer Prize winner Percival Everett on March 19.

The library has also expanded digital services with hoopla's BingePass, giving cardholders seven days of unlimited streaming access to movies, TV shows, documentaries, and educational content from platforms like Curiosity Stream and BBC programming. For families, Children's Librarian staff has created over 400 early learning videos since 2020, now organized into 16 categories covering everything from Spanish language content to virtual field trips. Additionally, the library highlighted Creativebug, a crafting resource offering more than 1,000 video classes, and published comprehensive tech guides including webpage translation tutorials available in Spanish and Polish.

Oak Park residents can also explore the library's annual "Best of 2025" reading and viewing recommendations curated by staff across all age groups, from adult fiction and teen selections to children's books and entertainment options. The library will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day with a "Dream Hands" display at the Main Library through January 28, where residents can contribute their personal dreams to a community tribute, while digital resources about Dr. King remain available through platforms like Hoopla and Kanopy.

**Oak Park Library Launches Health and Wellness Initiative for 2026**

The Oak Park Library is kicking off the new year with a comprehensive health and wellness program designed to help residents reset and connect during the cold winter months. The centerpiece of the initiative is the "Six in 2026" campaign, which encourages residents to read for just six minutes daily. This goal is backed by University of Sussex research showing that six minutes of reading can significantly reduce stress by lowering heart rate, easing muscle tension, and calming the nervous system, while other studies indicate that regular reading helps slow cognitive decline and protect memory function.

**Diverse Programming for Community Wellness**

The library is offering a robust lineup of events throughout winter 2026, including virtual Chair Yoga sessions every Tuesday at 12:30 pm and monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions at the Main Library. For those seeking outdoor activities, the library has partnered with Trailside Museum of Natural History to offer community-building events like "Nature Walk & Mingle for Singles" on February 14 and "Winter Tree ID Hike" on February 20. Virtual programming includes sessions on creating eco-friendly backyards (January 28), baking techniques (February 11), and an author talk with Pulitzer Prize winner Percival Everett (March 19).

The initiative reflects the library's commitment to supporting residents' physical and mental health during the winter season, with Health & Wellness Specialist Claire Ong emphasizing that the programs are designed to help people "relax, reset, and refocus" while building community connections.

- **Date:** January 8, 2026

The Oak Park library system has published new guidance on screen time and educational apps for young children ages 2-6, authored by Children's Librarian Eileen Saam. The recommendations align with American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which suggest limiting screen time to one hour daily for children 2-5 years old, with adult supervision and interaction required for children under 2. The guidance emphasizes that digital media should be developmentally appropriate, support school readiness skills, and encourage active learning when paired with hands-on activities.

The library has curated a list of nine recommended educational apps ranging from free to $8.99, covering skills like alphabet learning, emotional regulation, coding basics, and science exploration. Featured apps include Khan Academy Kids (free comprehensive learning), Breath, Think, Do with Sesame Street for emotional skills, and Lightbot Jr. for early coding concepts. The recommendations stress selecting apps that offer unique experiences, encourage interaction, and support specific developmental goals like problem-solving and literacy skills.

This guidance provides Oak Park families with expert-vetted digital learning tools and establishes clear parameters for healthy screen time use. The library's approach helps parents navigate the growing world of children's educational technology while ensuring screen time remains beneficial rather than passive entertainment.

The text you've shared contains step-by-step craft instructions for creating a paper snowflake, including folding techniques and cutting patterns. This doesn't appear to be a news article about Oak Park or contain any information about local announcements, events, or community impact.

Could you please share the actual Oak Park news article you'd like me to summarize? I'd be happy to provide a 2-3 paragraph summary focusing on the main announcement, key details, and impact on residents once I have the correct article.

I notice this appears to be the table of contents and introduction pages from a book titled "The Art of Play: Helping Adults Reclaim Imagination and Spontaneity" by Adam and Allee Blatner, rather than a news article about Oak Park.

This is actually a book about using imaginative play and drama techniques with adults for recreational, educational, and therapeutic purposes. The book discusses:

- The psychology and philosophy of play
- Methods for sociodramatic enactment with adults
- Benefits of imaginative role-playing
- Techniques for developing characters and dramatic scenes
- Applications in education and psychotherapy
- Cultural factors that inhibit adult playfulness

Since this is not a news article about Oak Park, I cannot provide the requested summary about local events or their impact on Oak Park residents. If you have an actual Oak Park news article you'd like me to summarize, please share that instead.
