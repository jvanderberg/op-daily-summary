## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library is offering extensive holiday support through digital resources, creative workshops, and special programming to help residents navigate the holiday season. Older Adult Services Librarian Claire Steiner announced six key ways library cardholders can use their services, including accessing Creativebug for craft tutorials, using the Creative Studio to make personalized gifts, and consulting Consumer Reports for gift-buying guidance.

The library is hosting several holiday-themed workshops and events, including sublimation workshops for custom mugs (December 9) and ornaments (December 16), virtual cooking programs, and performances like Noteworthy on December 3 and a Kwanzaa celebration on December 30. Additional wellness programming includes chair yoga sessions and sound bath meditation to help residents manage holiday stress.

These services provide Oak Park residents with both practical holiday assistance and opportunities for relaxation during what can be a stressful season. The library's digital cookbook collections, entertainment streaming through Kanopy and Hoopla, plus museum passes and park district access give cardholders numerous options for both holiday preparation and enjoyable downtime activities throughout the season.
