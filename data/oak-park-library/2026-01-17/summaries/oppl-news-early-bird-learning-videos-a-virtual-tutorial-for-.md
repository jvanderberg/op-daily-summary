## Summary

Oak Park Public Library's children's staff has created an impressive collection of over 400 early learning videos since March 2020, according to Children's Librarian Shelley Harris. These educational videos are organized into 16 categories including art, Spanish language content, life skills, and supported learning, all available through a YouTube playlist and the library's Early Learning page.

To help families navigate this extensive collection more easily, the library has launched a new virtual tutorial that allows users to explore videos by topic. The current collections cover areas such as activities for babies and toddlers, seasonal learning, caregiver guidance, reading readiness, social-emotional learning, and virtual field trips. The library is continuing to expand these collections and encourages community input on desired topics.

This digital initiative represents Oak Park Public Library's commitment to supporting early childhood education and literacy, providing families with accessible, research-based learning tools during and beyond the pandemic. Parents and caregivers can also subscribe to the Early Bird Learner Letter for additional activities and resources.
