## Summary

**Oak Park Library Honors Martin Luther King Jr. Day with Community Engagement Activities**

The Oak Park library system will be closed on Monday, January 19 for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but has organized special programming to help residents celebrate the civil rights leader's life and legacy. The library has curated recommended titles and online resources focused on Dr. King and the civil rights movement to encourage continued learning and reflection.

As a community tribute, the library is hosting a "Dream Hands" display at the Main Library through January 28. Residents can pick up blank paper hands at the Main Library, write or draw their personal dreams on them, and return them to staff for display in the Idea Box windows. Additionally, library cardholders can access digital resources including biographies, movies, and educational materials about Dr. King through the library's online platforms like Hoopla, Libby, and Kanopy, allowing for continued exploration of his impact on American history from home.
