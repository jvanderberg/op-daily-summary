## Summary

I don't see a complete news article in what you've shared - this appears to be just a fragment or instruction box from what might be a larger piece about a community event. The text mentions dropping off letters to Santa at 171 S. Oak Park Avenue between November 29 and December 19, and includes an option for people to opt out of having photos shared on social media or in print.

To provide you with a proper 2-3 paragraph summary focusing on the main announcement, key details, and impact on Oak Park residents, I would need to see the full news article. Could you please share the complete article you'd like me to summarize?
