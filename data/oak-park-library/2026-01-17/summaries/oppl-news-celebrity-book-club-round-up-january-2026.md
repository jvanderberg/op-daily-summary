## Summary

## Oak Park Libraries Highlight January Celebrity Book Club Picks

The Oak Park Public Library is featuring January selections from various celebrity book clubs, offering residents a chance to read alongside famous personalities. Collection Management Librarian Dontaná has compiled picks from well-established clubs like Oprah's Book Club (which started the celebrity book club trend in 1996) and newer ones from celebrities including Reese Witherspoon, Jenna Bush Hager, and RuPaul.

The featured titles span multiple genres, from Paula McLain's historical fiction "Skylark" (Good Morning America Book Club) to Mark Ronson's memoir about 1990s NYC DJ culture "Night People" (Dua Lipa's Service95). Other selections include Laura Dave's thriller sequel "The First Time I Saw Him" (Reese's Book Club) and Jennifer Finney Boylan's exploration of gender in "Cleavage" (RuPaul's Book Club). Since many titles are new releases, the library has ordered extra copies and encourages patrons to check the new materials shelves at Maze and Dole branches, as well as Hot Picks at the Main Library for immediate availability without holds or renewals.
