## Summary

I notice you've shared what appears to be instructions for making a paper snowflake, but you've asked me to summarize a news article about Oak Park. It seems like there might be a mismatch between the content you've provided and what you're looking for.

The text you've shared contains step-by-step craft instructions for creating a paper snowflake, including folding techniques and cutting patterns. This doesn't appear to be a news article about Oak Park or contain any information about local announcements, events, or community impact.

Could you please share the actual Oak Park news article you'd like me to summarize? I'd be happy to provide a 2-3 paragraph summary focusing on the main announcement, key details, and impact on residents once I have the correct article.
