**Oak Park Library Launches Health and Wellness Initiative for 2026**

The Oak Park Library is kicking off the new year with a comprehensive health and wellness program designed to help residents reset and connect during the cold winter months. The centerpiece of the initiative is the "Six in 2026" campaign, which encourages residents to read for just six minutes daily. This goal is backed by University of Sussex research showing that six minutes of reading can significantly reduce stress by lowering heart rate, easing muscle tension, and calming the nervous system, while other studies indicate that regular reading helps slow cognitive decline and protect memory function.

**Diverse Programming for Community Wellness**

The library is offering a robust lineup of events throughout winter 2026, including virtual Chair Yoga sessions every Tuesday at 12:30 pm and monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions at the Main Library. For those seeking outdoor activities, the library has partnered with Trailside Museum of Natural History to offer community-building events like "Nature Walk & Mingle for Singles" on February 14 and "Winter Tree ID Hike" on February 20. Virtual programming includes sessions on creating eco-friendly backyards (January 28), baking techniques (February 11), and an author talk with Pulitzer Prize winner Percival Everett (March 19).

The initiative reflects the library's commitment to supporting residents' physical and mental health during the winter season, with Health & Wellness Specialist Claire Ong emphasizing that the programs are designed to help people "relax, reset, and refocus" while building community connections.
