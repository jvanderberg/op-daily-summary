## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library has published a comprehensive guide on how to translate webpages using different internet browsers. The tutorial, written by John Gargiulo, the Supervising Librarian of Creative Technology, provides step-by-step instructions for translating web content in Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The guide addresses the common need for webpage translation when sites don't provide built-in language switching options.

The article offers detailed instructions for each browser, including how to set preferred languages, enable automatic translation features, and manually translate specific pages. For Google Chrome users, the guide explains how to access translation through the three-dot menu and set up auto-translate preferences. Safari users learn to configure preferred languages through the View menu, while Firefox and Edge users receive specific instructions for their respective browsers' translation capabilities.

This resource directly benefits Oak Park residents by making online information more accessible to non-English speakers and those learning new languages. The library staff has also provided Spanish and Polish translations of the entire guide, demonstrating their commitment to serving the diverse linguistic needs of the community. Residents can contact the library with additional technology questions or sign up for regular tech tip emails for ongoing digital literacy support.
