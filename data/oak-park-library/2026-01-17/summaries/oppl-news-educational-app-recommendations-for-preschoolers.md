## Summary

The Oak Park library system has published new guidance on screen time and educational apps for young children ages 2-6, authored by Children's Librarian Eileen Saam. The recommendations align with American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which suggest limiting screen time to one hour daily for children 2-5 years old, with adult supervision and interaction required for children under 2. The guidance emphasizes that digital media should be developmentally appropriate, support school readiness skills, and encourage active learning when paired with hands-on activities.

The library has curated a list of nine recommended educational apps ranging from free to $8.99, covering skills like alphabet learning, emotional regulation, coding basics, and science exploration. Featured apps include Khan Academy Kids (free comprehensive learning), Breath, Think, Do with Sesame Street for emotional skills, and Lightbot Jr. for early coding concepts. The recommendations stress selecting apps that offer unique experiences, encourage interaction, and support specific developmental goals like problem-solving and literacy skills.

This guidance provides Oak Park families with expert-vetted digital learning tools and establishes clear parameters for healthy screen time use. The library's approach helps parents navigate the growing world of children's educational technology while ensuring screen time remains beneficial rather than passive entertainment.
