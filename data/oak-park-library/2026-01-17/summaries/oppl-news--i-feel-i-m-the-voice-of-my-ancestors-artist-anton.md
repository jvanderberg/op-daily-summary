## Summary

Artist Antonia Ruppert, working toward her MFA degree, is creating a powerful exhibition exploring her family roots after receiving memorabilia from her cousin during a trip to Alabama last year. The collection includes a photograph of her grandfather, Prince James, a sharecropper who supported 11 children during the Jim Crow era. Using the poster printer at Oak Park's Main Library Creative Studio, Ruppert created a large-scale mixed-media painting called "The Greatest of These Is Love," which features her grandfather at the center surrounded by images of different family generations and symbolic plant foliage representing growth.

Ruppert's work is part of her final MFA project titled "Shared Hope: The Profound Power of Art and Music in Community," which examines how art and music provide hope despite challenges like injustice and disinvestment. The painting will be displayed at the Main Library's Kwanzaa Celebration on December 30, alongside works by other artists including Tia Etu and Hasani Cannon. The evening will feature dance, drumming, poetry, and storytelling in honor of this Black American Harvest celebration, and all Oak Park residents are invited to attend this cultural event.
