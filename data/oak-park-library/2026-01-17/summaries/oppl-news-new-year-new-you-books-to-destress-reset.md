## Summary

I apologize, but this appears to be content from a library's website or newsletter promoting wellness resources rather than a traditional news article about Oak Park. The text describes library recommendations for stress-reduction materials including books, digital resources, documentaries, and courses available through platforms like Hoopla and Kanopy.

Without additional context about which Oak Park library system this refers to or any specific announcement details (dates, events, new services), I cannot provide a proper news summary with the who, what, when, where information you requested. If you have the full news article or additional details about this library announcement, please share them and I'll be happy to summarize the news properly.
