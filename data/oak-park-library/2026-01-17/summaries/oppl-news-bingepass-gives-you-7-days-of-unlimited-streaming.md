## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library has announced the availability of hoopla's BingePass service, which allows library cardholders to access unlimited streaming content for seven days with a single borrow. This digital service provides access to a vast array of entertainment and educational content across multiple categories including movies, TV shows, documentaries, magazines, comics, games, fitness programs, educational courses, and children's content.

The BingePass collection features content for all ages, with specialized sections for adults/teens and children. Popular offerings include Curiosity Stream documentaries, Hallmark+ movies, BBC programming, The Great Courses educational videos, Ken Burns documentaries, PBS Kids shows, and fitness programs from Get Healthy U TV. For children specifically, there are interactive learning activities, read-along books, STEM resources, and popular characters like Curious George and Pokémon.

Oak Park residents can access BingePasses through the hoopla app on mobile devices or through a web browser using their library card credentials. Once borrowed, users are logged directly into partner platforms where they can explore unlimited content for the full seven-day period. When the borrowing period expires, residents can simply borrow the same BingePass again to continue accessing the content.
