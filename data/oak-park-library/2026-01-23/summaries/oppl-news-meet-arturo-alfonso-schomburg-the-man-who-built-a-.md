## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library is celebrating Black History Month by highlighting the life and contributions of Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, a Puerto Rican historian, writer, curator, and activist born in 1874. Schomburg moved to New York City at age 17, where he became involved in Puerto Rican and Cuban independence movements while developing his passion for Black history. This interest was sparked in childhood when a teacher told him that Black culture lacked noteworthy history, motivating him to make collecting and documenting African and African diasporic contributions his life's work.

Schomburg's extensive collection of intellectual, artistic, and cultural materials from African and African-descended individuals became the foundation for what is now the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. His work had an enormous influence on the Harlem Renaissance. The library is encouraging Oak Park residents to explore Schomburg's legacy using their library cards to access various digital resources, including biographical databases, online articles, NPR segments, and educational videos about this important but often overlooked historical figure.
