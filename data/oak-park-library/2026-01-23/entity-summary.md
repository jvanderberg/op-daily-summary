# Oak Park Public Library - 2026-01-23

Oak Park Public Library is celebrating Black History Month by spotlighting Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, a Puerto Rican historian whose life mission began when a teacher told him that Black culture had no noteworthy history. That dismissive comment sparked Schomburg's lifelong dedication to collecting and documenting African and African diasporic contributions. After moving to New York City at 17, he built an extensive collection of intellectual, artistic, and cultural materials that became the foundation for Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and significantly influenced the Harlem Renaissance.

The library is also addressing conversations about gender identity through resources for young learners and their families. Children's librarian Hal, who specializes in Rainbow Services, acknowledges that many parents feel uncertain about discussing gender topics with kids. The library offers a Transgender Resource Collection and story-based materials to help families navigate these conversations, emphasizing that gender exists on a broader spectrum than traditional binary definitions.

Residents can explore both topics using their library cards to access digital databases, articles, videos, and other educational materials about Schomburg's legacy and inclusive resources for supporting LGBTQ+ youth.

The Oak Park Public Library is celebrating Black History Month by highlighting the life and contributions of Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, a Puerto Rican historian, writer, curator, and activist born in 1874. Schomburg moved to New York City at age 17, where he became involved in Puerto Rican and Cuban independence movements while developing his passion for Black history. This interest was sparked in childhood when a teacher told him that Black culture lacked noteworthy history, motivating him to make collecting and documenting African and African diasporic contributions his life's work.

Schomburg's extensive collection of intellectual, artistic, and cultural materials from African and African-descended individuals became the foundation for what is now the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. His work had an enormous influence on the Harlem Renaissance. The library is encouraging Oak Park residents to explore Schomburg's legacy using their library cards to access various digital resources, including biographical databases, online articles, NPR segments, and educational videos about this important but often overlooked historical figure.

For Oak Park residents, this represents the library's commitment to providing inclusive educational resources and support for LGBTQ+ youth and their families. The library offers a Transgender Resource Collection and story-based materials to help facilitate these important conversations, with Hal specializing in serving LGBTQ+ young people through collaborative storytelling and imaginative play activities.
