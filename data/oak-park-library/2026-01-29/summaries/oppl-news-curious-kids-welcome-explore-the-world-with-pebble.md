## Summary

The Oak Park Public Library is promoting PebbleGo and PebbleGo Next, digital learning platforms available to local families with library cards. Children's Librarian Eileen Saam highlights these educational resources designed for students in grades K-5, which offer interactive content including articles, multimedia, games, and lessons on topics ranging from animals and science to social studies and biographies.

The platforms are tailored by age group: PebbleGo serves grades K-3 with foundational topics, while PebbleGo Next targets grades 3-5 with more advanced subjects including Indigenous peoples' history and state studies. Both resources include literacy support features such as audio narration, highlighted text, and vocabulary building tools to help children develop reading skills and digital literacy while exploring topics that match their interests and curiosity.

Oak Park families can access these educational tools immediately using their library cards, providing children with opportunities for both independent learning and school project research from home.
