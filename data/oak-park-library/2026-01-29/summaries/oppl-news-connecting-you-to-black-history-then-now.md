Oak Park Public Library is celebrating Black History Month with a comprehensive collection of books, art exhibits, and community events running through February. The library has curated reading lists for all ages featuring titles by Black creators, along with streaming resources available through Kanopy and Hoopla that include films, documentaries, ebooks, and music.

Two major art exhibitions are currently on display: "Dreamscapes" by Amani Borah in the Main Library Gallery (through February 28), showcasing colorful scenes from Mombasa and Nairobi including fishermen, villagers, and dream-inspired fairy villages; and "Rapbrary Deangelo & the Dandelion" in the Idea Box (January 29-February 27), an immersive experience curated by Roy Kinsey featuring installations, performances, and artwork centered around the tender story of a creative Black child.

The library has scheduled multiple community events throughout February, including discussions on "A Woman of Endurance" exploring Puerto Rico's slave trade history, a presentation on the Great Migration and World War I by historian Clarence Goodman, storytelling with Mama Edie about marching with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and an environmental book discussion featuring "Black Earth Wisdom." Oak Park residents can also access specialized online databases for African American history research and genealogy using their library cards.
