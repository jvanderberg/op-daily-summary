## Summary

This article by Simon Czerwinskyj, Oak Park Public Library's Civic Literacy Librarian, focuses on helping residents develop better media literacy skills as they navigate today's complex information landscape. With another election cycle approaching, Czerwinskyj emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between misinformation (false information shared without intent to deceive) and disinformation (deliberately misleading false information).

The article provides Oak Park residents with a practical 9-step guide to improve media literacy, including evaluating sources, reading beyond headlines, checking author credentials, verifying supporting sources and images, confirming publication dates, recognizing potential satire, examining personal biases, and consulting experts. Czerwinskyj notes that the library's staff is available to assist residents with fact-checking and provides access to reliable sources and research assistance.

This guidance serves Oak Park residents by equipping them with tools to better evaluate the constant flow of information from news articles and social media posts. The library has also updated its Media Literacy Resources page and offers additional digital resources and tech support to help community members become more discerning consumers of information during this critical time.
