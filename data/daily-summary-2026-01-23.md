# Oak Park Government Daily Summary - 2026-01-23

Oak Park is opening multiple warming centers this week as dangerous cold temperatures hit the area. Good Shepherd Lutheran Church is serving as a warming center through Saturday, followed by the Bridge Center at St. Catherine/St. Lucy through Monday morning. All three library branches are also available during regular hours, and residents needing transportation can call the police non-emergency line at 708.386.3800.

The Village is now offering free flu and COVID combination tests at Village Hall's Welcome Center during business hours - timely given that flu hospitalizations have hit their highest levels in over two decades. Call 708.358.5480 to check availability before heading over. Oak Park also earned some recognition, becoming the only Illinois municipality to receive an 'A' rating from CDP for environmental leadership among more than 1,000 cities that reported environmental data.

OPRF High School switched to virtual learning Friday due to the Extreme Cold Warning, with classes running 8 a.m. to 3:11 p.m. through Google classrooms. While daytime practices and activities were canceled, evening events continued as planned.

The Park District is gearing up for a big year of community input. They're planning resident meetings for improvements at Oak Park Conservatory (May 13), Rehm Park (October 14), and Euclid Square Park (November 4). More immediately, they're pushing a $40 million bond referendum for the March 17 ballot to build an indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common. The 20-year bonds would cost homeowners about $160 annually for a typical $430,000 home. Three information sessions are scheduled - January 22, February 4, and February 25 at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center.

The library is highlighting Black History Month by featuring Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, whose life work began when a teacher dismissed Black cultural contributions. His subsequent collection efforts helped establish Harlem's Schomburg Center and influenced the Harlem Renaissance.

## Village of Oak Park

Oak Park is dealing with dangerous cold temperatures this week, with warming centers activated at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church through Saturday and then at the Bridge Center at St. Catherine/St. Lucy through Monday morning. All three Oak Park Public Library branches will also serve as warming centers during regular hours, and residents needing transportation to these centers can call the police non-emergency number at 708.386.3800.

The Village has also announced that free flu and COVID-19 combination tests are now available at Village Hall's Welcome Center during weekday business hours. This comes as hospital admissions for flu-like illnesses have reached their highest levels nationally in over two decades. Residents experiencing symptoms like fever, cough, breathing difficulties, fatigue, or sore throat can get tested while supplies last - call 708.358.5480 to confirm availability before visiting.

In other news, Oak Park earned an 'A' rating from CDP for environmental leadership, becoming the only Illinois municipality to receive this recognition among more than 1,000 cities that reported environmental data in 2025. The Village is also transitioning to a new emergency alert system through Everbridge - all residents need to register at oak-park.us/notifyme to continue receiving emergency notifications about severe weather, snow emergencies, and other important alerts.


## OPRF High School District 200

Oak Park and River Forest High School will operate as an E-Learning Day on Friday, January 23, 2026, due to an Extreme Cold Warning predicting dangerous temperatures and wind chills through noon. Classes will run virtually from 8:00 a.m. to 3:11 p.m., with students expected to log into their Google classrooms with cameras on while teachers provide live instruction and take attendance.

All before and after-school practices and extracurricular activities are canceled for Friday, though evening performances and competitions will still happen as planned. Saturday activities are expected to continue normally unless the district announces otherwise. The school emphasizes they'll continue monitoring weather conditions and will update the community through official channels if anything changes.

## Park District of Oak Park

The Park District of Oak Park is preparing for significant community engagement in 2026, starting with three park planning meetings where residents can help shape improvements at Oak Park Conservatory (May 13), Rehm Park (October 14), and Euclid Square Park (November 4). These sessions are part of the district's policy to review each park every 10 years and will help identify needed amenities and prepare for future grant opportunities.

The district has earned impressive recognition for its operations and safety standards. Their aquatics team received the 2025 Platinum International Aquatic Safety Award, placing them among the top 10% nationally with audit scores of 97.78% or higher. They've also achieved both state and national accreditation - earning Illinois Distinguished Accredited Agency status from IAPD/IPRA and becoming nationally accredited through CAPRA, joining an elite group that meets 154 rigorous operational standards.

Most significantly for residents, the Park District will place a $40 million bond referendum on the March 17, 2026 ballot to fund an indoor aquatics facility at Ridgeland Common. The proposed facility would include lap pools, a therapy pool, and an indoor splash pad, funded through 20-year bonds that would cost homeowners about $13.36 monthly ($160 annually for a $430,000 home). Three community information sessions are scheduled for January 22, February 4, and February 25 at 7 p.m. at the Community Recreation Center for residents to learn more before voting.

## Oak Park Public Library

Oak Park Public Library is celebrating Black History Month by spotlighting Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, a Puerto Rican historian whose life mission began when a teacher told him that Black culture had no noteworthy history. That dismissive comment sparked Schomburg's lifelong dedication to collecting and documenting African and African diasporic contributions. After moving to New York City at 17, he built an extensive collection of intellectual, artistic, and cultural materials that became the foundation for Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and significantly influenced the Harlem Renaissance.

The library is also addressing conversations about gender identity through resources for young learners and their families. Children's librarian Hal, who specializes in Rainbow Services, acknowledges that many parents feel uncertain about discussing gender topics with kids. The library offers a Transgender Resource Collection and story-based materials to help families navigate these conversations, emphasizing that gender exists on a broader spectrum than traditional binary definitions.

Residents can explore both topics using their library cards to access digital databases, articles, videos, and other educational materials about Schomburg's legacy and inclusive resources for supporting LGBTQ+ youth.
