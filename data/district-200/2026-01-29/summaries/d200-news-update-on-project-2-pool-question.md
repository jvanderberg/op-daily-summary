## Summary

Oak Park's Project 2 is nearing completion with new physical education facilities, including a 25-yard by 40-yard pool, set to open this fall. The project has generated significant community interest, particularly regarding public access to the new swimming facility.

While the pool will primarily serve curricular and athletic programs, officials are exploring expanded community access options. The facility will maintain existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park and the West Suburban Special Recreation Association (WSSRA), and administrators are considering additional public swimming opportunities including Sunday hours, weekday evening sessions, periodic community open swims, and limited summer availability.

This development represents a significant addition to Oak Park's recreational infrastructure, with more details about community access schedules expected to be announced in the coming months as the facility approaches its fall opening.
