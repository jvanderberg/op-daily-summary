## Summary

The Oak Park and River Forest High School Jazz Ensemble, led by Director Anthony Svejda, has earned a prestigious invitation to perform at the 2026 Illinois Music Education Conference (IMEC) in Peoria on January 29. This rare honor, awarded to only a handful of ensembles statewide, recognizes the group's exceptional talent and artistic discipline after a rigorous months-long audition process that included recording repertoire and hosting guest clinicians.

The 22-member ensemble's repertoire features innovative selections beyond traditional jazz literature, including an Afro-Peruvian piece called "Quadra 11" that Svejda discovered through his son's playlist and obtained directly from composer Anibal Seminario. To enhance authenticity, the group worked with jazz percussion expert Juan Pastor from North Central College, creating what Svejda called a "full-circle moment" in music education.

Oak Park residents will have two opportunities to see the acclaimed ensemble perform locally: a February 3 concert at OPRF featuring both the Jazz Ensemble and middle school feeder groups, and a special February 18 performance at Chicago's Jazz Showcase where they'll open for jazz great Bob Lark. This recognition comes as the district prepares to invest in new performing arts facilities through Act 3 campus construction, demonstrating ongoing commitment to supporting student excellence in the arts.
