# OPRF High School District 200 - 2026-01-29

Oak Park's high school is making notable progress on multiple fronts this winter. The district's new Project 2 pool is set to open this fall, featuring a 25-yard by 40-yard swimming facility that will primarily serve students but may offer expanded community access through Sunday hours, evening sessions, and periodic open swims. Officials are working out the details for public use while maintaining existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park.

The OPRF Jazz Ensemble has earned statewide recognition with an invitation to perform at the prestigious Illinois Music Education Conference in Peoria on January 29, 2026 - an honor given to only a select few ensembles across the state. Local residents can catch the acclaimed 22-member group at two upcoming performances: February 3 at the high school and February 18 at Chicago's Jazz Showcase, where they'll open for jazz artist Bob Lark.

Meanwhile, school will proceed as scheduled on Monday, January 26, despite dangerous wind chills between -15 and -20 degrees forecast through noon. The district is encouraging families to dress warmly and limit outdoor exposure while maintaining normal operations.

Oak Park's Project 2 is nearing completion with new physical education facilities, including a 25-yard by 40-yard pool, set to open this fall. The project has generated significant community interest, particularly regarding public access to the new swimming facility.

While the pool will primarily serve curricular and athletic programs, officials are exploring expanded community access options. The facility will maintain existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park and the West Suburban Special Recreation Association (WSSRA), and administrators are considering additional public swimming opportunities including Sunday hours, weekday evening sessions, periodic community open swims, and limited summer availability.

This development represents a significant addition to Oak Park's recreational infrastructure, with more details about community access schedules expected to be announced in the coming months as the facility approaches its fall opening.

The Oak Park and River Forest High School Jazz Ensemble, led by Director Anthony Svejda, has earned a prestigious invitation to perform at the 2026 Illinois Music Education Conference (IMEC) in Peoria on January 29. This rare honor, awarded to only a handful of ensembles statewide, recognizes the group's exceptional talent and artistic discipline after a rigorous months-long audition process that included recording repertoire and hosting guest clinicians.

The 22-member ensemble's repertoire features innovative selections beyond traditional jazz literature, including an Afro-Peruvian piece called "Quadra 11" that Svejda discovered through his son's playlist and obtained directly from composer Anibal Seminario. To enhance authenticity, the group worked with jazz percussion expert Juan Pastor from North Central College, creating what Svejda called a "full-circle moment" in music education.

Oak Park residents will have two opportunities to see the acclaimed ensemble perform locally: a February 3 concert at OPRF featuring both the Jazz Ensemble and middle school feeder groups, and a special February 18 performance at Chicago's Jazz Showcase where they'll open for jazz great Bob Lark. This recognition comes as the district prepares to invest in new performing arts facilities through Act 3 campus construction, demonstrating ongoing commitment to supporting student excellence in the arts.
