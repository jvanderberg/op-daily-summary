## Summary

Oak Park and River Forest High School (OPRFHS) will hold an E-Learning Day on Friday, January 23, 2026, due to an Extreme Cold Warning issued by the National Weather Service. The warning predicts dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills from 3 a.m. through noon on Friday, prompting Superintendent Dr. Greg Johnson to close the physical school building for safety reasons.

During the E-Learning Day, classes will run virtually from 8:00 a.m. to 3:11 p.m., with teachers providing synchronous instruction and taking attendance. Students are expected to log into their Google classrooms and have their cameras on during classes. All before-school and after-school practices and extracurricular activities are canceled, though after-school performances and competitions will proceed as scheduled. Saturday activities are expected to continue unless otherwise announced.

The decision impacts all OPRFHS students, staff, and families, allowing the district to maintain educational continuity while prioritizing safety during extreme weather conditions. The school district emphasizes this closure decision was not made lightly and encourages the community to monitor official channels for further updates about weather-related impacts on school operations.
