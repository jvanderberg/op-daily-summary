**Oak Park School Issues Final Call for Lost Items Before Winter Break**

Oak Park's school administration has announced a final opportunity for students and staff to retrieve lost belongings before the winter semester ends. Any unclaimed items remaining after December 19, 2025, will be donated to charity, making this the last chance to recover missing personal property.

The school has organized lost items into two main locations for easy retrieval. Smaller valuables like phones, keys, and wallets can be claimed at the Welcome Center, where staff can also provide information about missing bicycles. Larger items such as coats, lunch bags, and water bottles are stored in a dedicated Lost and Found closet located under the stairwell by Door 9, accessible with assistance from Campus Safety. The school recommends checking for lost items during lunch periods, passing times, or before and after school hours when staff are available to help locate missing belongings.
