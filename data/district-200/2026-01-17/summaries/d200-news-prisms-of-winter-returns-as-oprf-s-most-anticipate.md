## Summary

Oak Park and River Forest High School (OPRF) is bringing back its signature annual arts event, Prisms of Winter, for performances on December 11 & 12 at 7:00 p.m. in the school auditorium. This decade-long tradition is a 90-minute immersive musical experience featuring more than 25 performances from choir, orchestra, band, and over 18 student-led ensembles, typically drawing more than 2,600 attendees each year.

What makes Prisms unique is its format—rather than a traditional concert, performances unfold throughout the entire auditorium space with seamless, applause-free transitions as music emerges from different locations including the pit, center stage, and alcoves. The event culminates in a powerful finale featuring every student performer, with this year's closing piece blending Mozart's Lacrimosa with Orff's Carmina Burana.

For Oak Park residents, this represents one of the community's most anticipated cultural events, showcasing the exceptional talent and collaboration of local high school students. Students and faculty emphasize that Prisms fosters growth, teamwork, and a sense of being part of something larger than themselves. Tickets are now available through the OPRF Performing Arts Department, led by directors Anthony Svejda, Meredith McGuire, Patrick Pearson, and Brendon Culloton.
