## Summary

Oak Park and River Forest High School will host its annual Speech Team Performance Night on Tuesday, January 27 at 6:30 PM, providing the community with a unique opportunity to see student performances that typically only occur at competitive tournaments. More than 30 students will showcase a diverse range of speech events, including dramatic monologues, humorous duets, original speeches, political commentary, and simulated radio broadcasts.

The event began as a way for students to get their speeches approved for state competition but has evolved into a community celebration of student achievement. Co-coaches Matt Johnson and Patt Cheney emphasize that speech differs from debate, focusing on helping students find their voice, develop performance skills, and build confidence. The program is inclusive and welcomes all students regardless of experience level, with participants able to choose their level of involvement while receiving extensive coaching and feedback.

The free event offers Oak Park residents a chance to witness the transformative impact of speech competition on students, who develop critical thinking, clear writing, and confident speaking skills that benefit them beyond high school. Notable OPRF speech alumni include actor Thomas Lennon and Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, demonstrating the program's long-term impact on students' lives and careers.
