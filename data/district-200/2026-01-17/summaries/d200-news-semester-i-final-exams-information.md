## Summary

Oak Park and River Forest High School (OPRF) has announced its Semester I final exam schedule for the 2025-2026 school year. Final examinations will be administered over three days from Wednesday, December 17 through Friday, December 19, 2025, with a modified bell schedule featuring extended exam periods from 8:00 a.m. to 1:20 p.m. each day. Different class periods will be tested on different days according to the published schedule, with no advisory period during exam days.

Additionally, families should note that Skyward access will be unavailable from December 17 through January 8, 2026.
