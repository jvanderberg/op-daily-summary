## Summary

Oak Park and River Forest High School has welcomed its first full-time facility dog, Griff, to support student wellness and mental health. Griff comes to OPRFHS through Paws Giving Independence, a nonprofit service-dog organization, and will work alongside Prevention and Wellness Coordinator Ginger Bencola, who is trained in Animal-Assisted Social Work. This marks an expansion of the school's existing therapy dog program, which has operated with volunteer dogs for the past seven years.

Griff made his debut on Wednesday, December 3, and will be available to students on Tuesdays and Thursdays during lunch in the Student Activity Center. The facility dog will also be present in the Prevention & Wellness Office, during classroom lessons, in support groups, and at school events. Beginning next semester, teachers may request Griff's presence for specific lessons or stress-relief activities.

The program aims to reduce student stress and anxiety, increase engagement and confidence, and promote empathy and positive social behaviors. OPRFHS has implemented safety measures to ensure all students feel comfortable, including optional interactions, advance announcements of Griff's presence, accommodations for students with allergies or phobias, and an opt-out form for parents who prefer their children not interact with the facility dog.
