## Summary

Oak Park High School has announced mandatory group counselor meetings for all current freshmen (Class of 2029) scheduled for December 2nd and 5th in Lecture Hall 3130. The meetings will be held during various class periods throughout both days, with multiple counselors including Ms. Fuentes, Mr. Nixen, Ms. White, Ms. Hanson, Mr. Herbst, Mr. Sherman, and others leading different sessions.

The purpose of these meetings is to help freshman students explore career options that align with their strengths and skill sets using the Schoolinks platform, understand how their current courses connect to future job opportunities, and begin developing their four-year academic plans. This career and academic planning session is designed to prepare students for their upcoming individual course selection meetings with their counselors.

Students are instructed to attend the meeting time that best fits their schedule and report directly to Lecture Hall 3130 at the start of their designated period. Attendance will be taken at each session to ensure all freshmen participate in this important academic and career planning initiative.
