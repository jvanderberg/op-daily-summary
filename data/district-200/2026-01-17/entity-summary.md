Oak Park and River Forest High School will host its annual Speech Team Performance Night on Tuesday, January 27 at 6:30 PM, providing the community with a unique opportunity to see student performances that typically only occur at competitive tournaments. More than 30 students will showcase a diverse range of speech events, including dramatic monologues, humorous duets, original speeches, political commentary, and simulated radio broadcasts.

The event began as a way for students to get their speeches approved for state competition but has evolved into a community celebration of student achievement. Co-coaches Matt Johnson and Patt Cheney emphasize that speech differs from debate, focusing on helping students find their voice, develop performance skills, and build confidence. The program is inclusive and welcomes all students regardless of experience level, with participants able to choose their level of involvement while receiving extensive coaching and feedback.

The free event offers Oak Park residents a chance to witness the transformative impact of speech competition on students, who develop critical thinking, clear writing, and confident speaking skills that benefit them beyond high school. Notable OPRF speech alumni include actor Thomas Lennon and Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, demonstrating the program's long-term impact on students' lives and careers.

Oak Park and River Forest High School has welcomed its first full-time facility dog, Griff, to support student wellness and mental health. Griff comes to OPRFHS through Paws Giving Independence, a nonprofit service-dog organization, and will work alongside Prevention and Wellness Coordinator Ginger Bencola, who is trained in Animal-Assisted Social Work. This marks an expansion of the school's existing therapy dog program, which has operated with volunteer dogs for the past seven years.

Griff made his debut on Wednesday, December 3, and will be available to students on Tuesdays and Thursdays during lunch in the Student Activity Center. The facility dog will also be present in the Prevention & Wellness Office, during classroom lessons, in support groups, and at school events. Beginning next semester, teachers may request Griff's presence for specific lessons or stress-relief activities.

The program aims to reduce student stress and anxiety, increase engagement and confidence, and promote empathy and positive social behaviors. OPRFHS has implemented safety measures to ensure all students feel comfortable, including optional interactions, advance announcements of Griff's presence, accommodations for students with allergies or phobias, and an opt-out form for parents who prefer their children not interact with the facility dog.

Oak Park and River Forest High School (OPRF) is bringing back its signature annual arts event, Prisms of Winter, for performances on December 11 & 12 at 7:00 p.m. in the school auditorium. This decade-long tradition is a 90-minute immersive musical experience featuring more than 25 performances from choir, orchestra, band, and over 18 student-led ensembles, typically drawing more than 2,600 attendees each year.

What makes Prisms unique is its format—rather than a traditional concert, performances unfold throughout the entire auditorium space with seamless, applause-free transitions as music emerges from different locations including the pit, center stage, and alcoves. The event culminates in a powerful finale featuring every student performer, with this year's closing piece blending Mozart's Lacrimosa with Orff's Carmina Burana.

For Oak Park residents, this represents one of the community's most anticipated cultural events, showcasing the exceptional talent and collaboration of local high school students. Students and faculty emphasize that Prisms fosters growth, teamwork, and a sense of being part of something larger than themselves. Tickets are now available through the OPRF Performing Arts Department, led by directors Anthony Svejda, Meredith McGuire, Patrick Pearson, and Brendon Culloton.
