## Summary

Oak Park High School is hosting Junior Post-Secondary Planning Meetings on Tuesday, February 10 and Wednesday, February 11, 2026. These mandatory meetings are organized by school counselors to help junior students and their families navigate post-graduation options.

The meetings will cover essential topics including tools for finding suitable colleges and career paths, information about 2-year and 4-year degree programs, apprenticeship opportunities, and other post-secondary alternatives. Students are required to attend one of their assigned counselor's sessions during the two-day period.

This initiative directly impacts Oak Park junior students and their families by providing crucial guidance during a key decision-making period in their academic careers. The meetings aim to ensure students are well-informed about their various options beyond high school graduation.
