## Summary

Oak Park is moving forward with its new physical education facilities, which are scheduled for completion this fall. The project includes a new 25-yard by 40-yard community pool that has generated significant interest among residents regarding public access.

While the district will maintain existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park and the West Suburban Special Recreation Association (WSSRA), officials are also exploring expanded community access options. Under consideration are Sunday hours, weekday evening sessions, periodic open swim times, and summer availability, all scheduled around the school's academic and athletic programs.

The district promises to provide more detailed information about community pool access in the coming months as they finalize scheduling arrangements that balance educational needs with public use.
