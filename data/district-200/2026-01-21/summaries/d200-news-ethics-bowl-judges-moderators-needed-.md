## Summary

The Oak Park and River Forest High School is seeking volunteers to serve as judges and moderators for an upcoming Ethics Bowl competition. Elizabeth Nash, who can be reached at enash@oprfhs.org, is coordinating the volunteer recruitment effort.

This represents an opportunity for Oak Park area residents to get involved in supporting local students' academic and ethical reasoning development through this extracurricular activity.
