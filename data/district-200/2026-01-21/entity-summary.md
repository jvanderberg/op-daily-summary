# OPRF High School District 200 - 2026-01-21

Oak Park and River Forest High School is nearing completion of its new physical education facilities this fall, including a 25-yard by 40-yard community pool that has sparked considerable resident interest. While the district will continue its existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park and West Suburban Special Recreation Association, they're exploring expanded public access options like Sunday hours, weekday evenings, periodic open swim times, and summer availability - all worked around the school's academic and athletic schedule.

The school is also looking for community volunteers to judge and moderate an upcoming Ethics Bowl competition. No experience is necessary, and interested residents can contact Elizabeth Nash at enash@oprfhs.org to help support students in this academic competition focused on ethical reasoning.
