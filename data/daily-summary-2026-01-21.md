# Oak Park Government Daily Summary - 2026-01-21

The Village of Oak Park opened multiple warming centers this week as dangerous cold weather with below-zero wind chills hit the area. Good Shepherd Lutheran Church served as the primary shelter from Wednesday through Saturday, with St. Catherine/St. Lucy taking over 24/7 operations through Monday morning. All three library branches also provided warmth during regular hours, with police offering rides to those in need.

At Monday's Village Board meeting, trustees approved a partnership with the University of Illinois for grant-funded fire communications training for local emergency responders. They also held a study session on proposed Energy Grant Guidelines for the upcoming 2026 cycle.

Over at OPRF High School, the new physical education facilities are nearly complete, including a 25-yard by 40-yard community pool that's generating buzz among residents. While the district will keep its existing partnerships with the Park District and West Suburban Special Recreation Association, they're exploring expanded public access - potentially including Sunday hours, weekday evenings, and summer availability when it doesn't conflict with school activities. The school is also seeking community volunteers to help judge their upcoming Ethics Bowl competition - no experience required.

The Oak Park Public Library is rolling out tax season help with free printing (up to 50 pages) and computer access for filing returns by April 15. Hard copies of federal and state 1040 forms are available on the Main Library's third floor, plus they've compiled info on free filing services for qualifying residents.

The library is also launching "Six in 2026," a wellness initiative encouraging residents to read just six minutes daily for mental health benefits. Winter programming includes Chair Yoga on Tuesdays, monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions, and February nature walks with Trailside Museum. You can even borrow snowshoes and ice traction gear. Virtual events include a backyard nature talk January 28 and a special appearance by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Percival Everett on March 19.

## OPRF High School District 200

Oak Park and River Forest High School is nearing completion of its new physical education facilities this fall, including a 25-yard by 40-yard community pool that has sparked considerable resident interest. While the district will continue its existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park and West Suburban Special Recreation Association, they're exploring expanded public access options like Sunday hours, weekday evenings, periodic open swim times, and summer availability - all worked around the school's academic and athletic schedule.

The school is also looking for community volunteers to judge and moderate an upcoming Ethics Bowl competition. No experience is necessary, and interested residents can contact Elizabeth Nash at enash@oprfhs.org to help support students in this academic competition focused on ethical reasoning.

## Oak Park Public Library

The Oak Park Public Library is helping residents tackle tax season with free printing services and computer access for those filing by the April 15 deadline. You can print up to 50 pages of tax forms at no charge on library computers or through remote printing for same-day pickup. Limited hard copies of federal and state 1040 forms are available on the Main Library's third floor. For those needing help, the library has compiled information about free filing services available to qualifying residents, including IRS Free File (for those earning under $89,000) and assistance through organizations like AARP Tax Aid and Triton College.

Meanwhile, the library is launching its "Six in 2026" wellness initiative, encouraging residents to read just six minutes daily for mental health benefits like reduced stress and improved cognitive function. Health & Wellness Specialist Claire Ong is promoting this alongside winter programming that includes Chair Yoga (Tuesdays at 12:30 pm virtual), monthly Sound Bath Meditation sessions, and nature walks with Trailside Museum in February. Snowshoes and ice traction covers are available for loan.
