## Summary

**Oak Park Property Tax Bills Delayed by One Month**

Oak Park Township has announced that first installment property tax bills will be delayed by one month this year. Instead of the typical February 1 mailing with a March 1 due date, the bills will not be sent until early March and will be due on April 1, 2025.

This one-time extension was enacted by the Illinois state legislature to provide taxpayers with more time between tax bill payments. The delay became necessary because last year's second installment tax bills were pushed back to December 15 due to problems with Cook County's new computer system, creating only a two-and-a-half month gap between payment due dates. Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar and the Cook County Township Assessors Association advocated for the extension to prevent financial hardship for residents.

The Illinois legislature unanimously approved the one-month extension during their fall veto session, working until 3:30 AM on the final day to pass the measure. This change affects all Oak Park residents who pay property taxes and provides them additional breathing room between their tax obligations.
