**Date:** December 4, 2025

## Summary

The Cook County Board of Review is opening a second appeal period for Oak Park Township property assessments, running from December 3-12, 2025. Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar announced that residents can contact his office at (708) 383-8005 for assistance with filing appeals during this 10-day window.

However, there are important restrictions on who can file during this second period. Property owners who already submitted appeals during the first 2025 appeal period (which closed August 19) are not eligible to file again. Residents can check if they previously filed by visiting the Board of Review's website at cookcountyboardofreview.com and searching their property's PIN number. This second appeal period gives residents a chance to address assessment issues they may have noticed on their second installment tax bills that were mailed in November.

The impact of any successful 2025 appeals won't appear on tax bills until the second half of 2026. Results for all 2025 appeals from both periods will be released simultaneously sometime after mid-January 2026, meaning residents who filed in the first period are still waiting for their results as well.
