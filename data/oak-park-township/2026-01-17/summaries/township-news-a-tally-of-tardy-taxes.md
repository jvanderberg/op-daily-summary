## Summary

Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar announced that most Oak Park taxpayers are seeing a relatively uniform 4.5% increase in their second installment property tax bills this year. This contrasts sharply with last year's bills, which reflected the 2023 reassessment and showed much greater variability, with 35% of taxpayers receiving reductions while 39% faced double-digit increases. The current increase is primarily attributed to higher local tax levies totaling $264 million, representing a 3.3% increase over the previous year.

The tax bills are significantly delayed this year due to Cook County's computer system replacement. The county upgraded from a 1988 mainframe system to a new "Tyler" system, causing substantial delays in processing. As a result, second installment bills that are typically due August 1st are now due December 15th. This delay has created several complications for taxpayers, including the reopening of the appeal period (December 3-12), potential mortgage escrow account errors, and a postponement of next year's first installment due date from March 1st to April 1st, 2026. The Oak Park Township Assessor's office is available to help residents with appeals and escrow statement reviews during this transition period.
