## Summary

Cook County has extended and expanded its Homeowner Relief Fund, a one-time property tax relief program that provides $1,000 rebates to qualifying homeowners. The application deadline has been extended to October 31, and eligibility requirements have been relaxed by reducing the required year-over-year property tax increase from 50% to 30% for tax years 2021, 2022, or 2023.

To qualify, applicants must own single-family homes, condominiums, or small apartment buildings that serve as their primary residence and have experienced the 30% tax increase threshold. Additionally, household income cannot exceed the Area Median Income limits ($84,000 for single persons, $119,900 for families of four). Since the program only has funding for 13,600 households countywide and more applications are expected, recipients will be selected through a lottery system.

Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar noted that Oak Park residents are particularly likely to qualify, as many experienced significant tax increases in 2023 due to property reassessments. Residents can apply online at https://hrf.cookcountyil.gov/apply or contact the Oak Park Township Assessor's office at (708) 383-8005 for assistance with applications and program questions.
