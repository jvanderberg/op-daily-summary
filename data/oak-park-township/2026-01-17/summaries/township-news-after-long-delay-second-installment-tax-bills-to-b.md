## Summary

Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar announced that second installment tax bills will finally be issued after significant delays. The bills will be mailed on November 14 and are due by December 15, representing a major departure from the normal schedule where these bills should have been issued by July 1 and paid by August 1 under state law.

The extensive delays stem from Cook County's overhaul of its decades-old computer system from the 1980s. While the legacy system had successfully calculated tax bills for all 1.8 million Cook County properties for years, the transition to a new system encountered numerous problems that took much longer than expected to resolve. County officials needed additional time to ensure the new system would accurately calculate tax bills before issuing them.

The Assessor is advising Oak Park residents to carefully review their tax bills when they arrive to verify accuracy and confirm that all eligible tax exemptions appear on their bills. The Assessor's office will be available to answer questions and assist taxpayers with applying for any missing exemptions they may be entitled to receive.
