# Oak Park Township - 2026-01-17

**Township Addresses Property Tax Delays and Appeal Opportunities**

Oak Park residents are finally receiving their second installment property tax bills after significant delays caused by Cook County's computer system upgrade. The bills, mailed November 14 with a December 15 due date, show a relatively uniform 4.5% increase across the township - a stark contrast to last year's highly variable increases that ranged from reductions to double-digit hikes following the 2023 reassessment. The delays have created complications with mortgage escrow accounts and pushed next year's first installment due date from March 1 to April 1, 2026.

Property owners have a second chance to appeal their assessments during a 10-day window from December 3-12, but only if they didn't file during the first appeal period that closed in August. Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar's office is available at (708) 383-8005 to help residents determine if they previously filed and assist with new appeals. Additionally, Oak Park residents should consider applying for Cook County's expanded Homeowner Relief Fund, which offers $1,000 rebates to qualifying homeowners who experienced at least a 30% property tax increase. The application deadline is October 31, and many Oak Park residents likely qualify due to the 2023 reassessment impacts.

### A Tally of Tardy Taxes

- **Date:** December 11, 2025

Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar announced that most Oak Park taxpayers are seeing a relatively uniform 4.5% increase in their second installment property tax bills this year. This contrasts sharply with last year's bills, which reflected the 2023 reassessment and showed much greater variability, with 35% of taxpayers receiving reductions while 39% faced double-digit increases. The current increase is primarily attributed to higher local tax levies totaling $264 million, representing a 3.3% increase over the previous year.

The tax bills are significantly delayed this year due to Cook County's computer system replacement. The county upgraded from a 1988 mainframe system to a new "Tyler" system, causing substantial delays in processing. As a result, second installment bills that are typically due August 1st are now due December 15th. This delay has created several complications for taxpayers, including the reopening of the appeal period (December 3-12), potential mortgage escrow account errors, and a postponement of next year's first installment due date from March 1st to April 1st, 2026. The Oak Park Township Assessor's office is available to help residents with appeals and escrow statement reviews during this transition period.

### Board Of Review Accepting New Appeals For Ten Days

- **Date:** December 4, 2025

The Cook County Board of Review is opening a second appeal period for Oak Park Township property assessments, running from December 3-12, 2025. Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar announced that residents can contact his office at (708) 383-8005 for assistance with filing appeals during this 10-day window.

However, there are important restrictions on who can file during this second period. Property owners who already submitted appeals during the first 2025 appeal period (which closed August 19) are not eligible to file again. Residents can check if they previously filed by visiting the Board of Review's website at cookcountyboardofreview.com and searching their property's PIN number. This second appeal period gives residents a chance to address assessment issues they may have noticed on their second installment tax bills that were mailed in November.

The impact of any successful 2025 appeals won't appear on tax bills until the second half of 2026. Results for all 2025 appeals from both periods will be released simultaneously sometime after mid-January 2026, meaning residents who filed in the first period are still waiting for their results as well.

### After Long Delay, Second Installment Tax Bills To Be Issued

- **Date:** November 10, 2025

Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar announced that second installment tax bills will finally be issued after significant delays. The bills will be mailed on November 14 and are due by December 15, representing a major departure from the normal schedule where these bills should have been issued by July 1 and paid by August 1 under state law.

The extensive delays stem from Cook County's overhaul of its decades-old computer system from the 1980s. While the legacy system had successfully calculated tax bills for all 1.8 million Cook County properties for years, the transition to a new system encountered numerous problems that took much longer than expected to resolve. County officials needed additional time to ensure the new system would accurately calculate tax bills before issuing them.

The Assessor is advising Oak Park residents to carefully review their tax bills when they arrive to verify accuracy and confirm that all eligible tax exemptions appear on their bills. The Assessor's office will be available to answer questions and assist taxpayers with applying for any missing exemptions they may be entitled to receive.

### County’s One-Time Only Tax Relief Program Extended, Expanded
- **Type:** news
- **URL:** https://oakparktownship.org/2025/10/countys-one-time-only-tax-relief-program-extended-expanded/
- **Date:** October 19, 2025

Cook County has extended and expanded its Homeowner Relief Fund, a one-time property tax relief program that provides $1,000 rebates to qualifying homeowners. The application deadline has been extended to October 31, and eligibility requirements have been relaxed by reducing the required year-over-year property tax increase from 50% to 30% for tax years 2021, 2022, or 2023.

To qualify, applicants must own single-family homes, condominiums, or small apartment buildings that serve as their primary residence and have experienced the 30% tax increase threshold. Additionally, household income cannot exceed the Area Median Income limits ($84,000 for single persons, $119,900 for families of four). Since the program only has funding for 13,600 households countywide and more applications are expected, recipients will be selected through a lottery system.

Oak Park Township Assessor Ali ElSaffar noted that Oak Park residents are particularly likely to qualify, as many experienced significant tax increases in 2023 due to property reassessments. Residents can apply online at https://hrf.cookcountyil.gov/apply or contact the Oak Park Township Assessor's office at (708) 383-8005 for assistance with applications and program questions.
