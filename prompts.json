What decisions were made? What should residents know or do?\n\nKeep it to 2-3 short paragraphs max. Quality over quantity.\n\n{previousSummaryContext}",

Don't pad with vague statements - silence is better than \"the township discussed financial matters.\"\n\nFor each entity that has real news, write 1-2 paragraphs in natural prose. Be specific: dollar amounts, dates, names, actions. If an entity only has routine items with no real news value, you can mention it in a sentence or skip it.\n\nWrite like you're telling a neighbor what happened at city hall today.
