  <main><h1>Oak Park Government Daily Summary - 2026-01-29</h1>
<p>Oak Park honored its best property improvements at the 2025 Cavalcade of Pride Awards, recognizing six homes and several businesses for upgrades that enhance the village&#39;s architectural character.</p>
<p>With flu cases nationwide at their highest in over two decades, the Village is offering free flu and COVID-19 combination tests at Village Hall. The dangerous cold snap has prompted officials to open library branches as warming centers and remind residents to check on neighbors.</p>
<p>Oak Park earned recognition as the only Illinois municipality on CDP&#39;s 2025 environmental leadership list with an &#39;A&#39; score. The Village also approved its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest utility increases - refuse collection rises to about $31 monthly for 96-gallon carts. Residents need to register for the new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme, as the Village switched to a new Everbridge platform.</p>
<p>The high school&#39;s new Project 2 pool opens this fall with a 25-yard by 40-yard facility that will serve students and may offer limited community access. The OPRF Jazz Ensemble earned a prestigious invitation to perform at the Illinois Music Education Conference in January - catch them locally on February 3 at the high school or February 18 at Chicago&#39;s Jazz Showcase. Despite dangerous wind chills between -15 and -20 degrees, school continues Monday as scheduled.</p>
<p>The library&#39;s Civic Literacy Librarian published a 9-step guide to help residents spot misinformation ahead of election season, with staff available to help with fact-checking. For Black History Month, the library is featuring two art exhibitions and community events including discussions on Puerto Rico&#39;s slave trade history and a presentation on the Great Migration by historian Clarence Goodman.</p>

<h2>Village of Oak Park</h2>
<p>Oak Park celebrated its top property improvements at the 2025 Cavalcade of Pride Awards, recognizing six residential properties and several commercial properties for exceptional upgrades that enhance the village&#39;s architectural character. The awards highlight residents&#39; ongoing investment in maintaining Oak Park&#39;s distinctive neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The Village is taking action on several fronts to keep residents safe and informed. Free flu and COVID-19 combination tests are available at Village Hall during business hours as flu cases spike nationwide to their highest levels in over two decades. With dangerous cold weather hitting the area, the Public Library branches are serving as warming centers, and officials urge residents to check on neighbors while following safety guidelines like layering clothing and protecting pipes from freezing.</p>
<p>Oak Park achieved significant recognition by earning an &#39;A&#39; score from CDP, making it the only Illinois municipality on the organization&#39;s 2025 environmental leadership list. The Village also approved its $223 million budget for 2026, which includes modest increases in utility rates - refuse collection will rise to about $31 monthly for 96-gallon carts, while water and sewer rates increase slightly. Residents need to register for the new emergency alert system at oak-park.us/notifyme, as the Village has switched to a new Everbridge platform that allows customized notification preferences.</p>
<h2>OPRF High School District 200</h2>
<p>Oak Park&#39;s high school is making notable progress on multiple fronts this winter. The district&#39;s new Project 2 pool is set to open this fall, featuring a 25-yard by 40-yard swimming facility that will primarily serve students but may offer expanded community access through Sunday hours, evening sessions, and periodic open swims. Officials are working out the details for public use while maintaining existing partnerships with the Park District of Oak Park.</p>
<p>The OPRF Jazz Ensemble has earned statewide recognition with an invitation to perform at the prestigious Illinois Music Education Conference in Peoria on January 29, 2026 - an honor given to only a select few ensembles across the state. Local residents can catch the acclaimed 22-member group at two upcoming performances: February 3 at the high school and February 18 at Chicago&#39;s Jazz Showcase, where they&#39;ll open for jazz artist Bob Lark.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, school will proceed as scheduled on Monday, January 26, despite dangerous wind chills between -15 and -20 degrees forecast through noon. The district is encouraging families to dress warmly and limit outdoor exposure while maintaining normal operations.</p>
<h2>Oak Park Public Library</h2>
<p>Oak Park Public Library&#39;s Civic Literacy Librarian Simon Czerwinskyj has published a 9-step guide to help residents spot misinformation and disinformation as election season approaches. The practical tips cover essentials like evaluating sources, checking author credentials, verifying images, and recognizing personal biases. Library staff are available to help residents with fact-checking, and the library has updated its Media Literacy Resources page with additional digital tools.</p>
<p>The library is also highlighting PebbleGo and PebbleGo Next, interactive learning platforms available free to Oak Park families with library cards. These resources offer age-appropriate content for grades K-5, from basic topics like animals and science for younger kids to more advanced subjects including Indigenous history for older elementary students. The platforms include audio narration and vocabulary support to help children build reading and digital literacy skills.</p>
<p>For Black History Month, the library is featuring comprehensive programming through February, including curated reading lists, streaming resources, and two art exhibitions: &quot;Dreamscapes&quot; by Amani Borah showcasing colorful African scenes, and &quot;Rapbrary Deangelo &amp; the Dandelion,&quot; an immersive installation about a creative Black child. Community events include discussions on Puerto Rico&#39;s slave trade history, a presentation on the Great Migration by historian Clarence Goodman, and storytelling with Mama Edie about her experiences marching with Dr. King.</p>
